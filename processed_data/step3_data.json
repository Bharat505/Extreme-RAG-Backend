[Page 4] A Message from Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Lead Director April 1, 2024 Dear Fellow Stockholders, On behalf of the Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) and the Executive Leadership Team, we are pleased to invite you to participate in the 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the \u201cAnnual Meeting\u201d). [Page 4] The meeting will take place virtually on Tuesday, May 14, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. [Page 4] Central Daylight Time. [Page 4] There will be no in-person meeting. [Page 4] The attached Notice of the 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and Proxy Statement provides information about the business we plan to conduct. [Page 4] A Compelling 10-Year Plan At our 2023 Analyst & Investor Meeting, we reaffirmed our durable returns-focused value proposition with an updated 10-year financial plan that produces solid free cash flow, allowing us to reward stockholders now and into the future. [Page 4] As we enter 2024, ConocoPhillips continues to be guided by our Triple Mandate, which sets out three objectives to align our actions with the underlying realities of our business and demonstrates our commitment to create long-term value for our stockholders. [Page 4] First, we must reliably and responsibly deliver oil and gas production to meet energy transition pathway demand. [Page 4] Second, we must deliver competitive returns on and of capital for our stockholders. [Page 4] Third, we must remain focused on achieving our net-zero operational emissions ambition. [Page 4] Our Triple Mandate underlies our clearly defined value proposition of delivering superior returns through price cycles based on our foundational principles of balance sheet strength, peer- leading distributions, disciplined investments, and responsible and reliable environmental, social and governance performance. [Page 4] Continuing to Deliver on Each Pillar of The Triple Mandate In 2023, we continued to deliver on each of the three mandates: First, we achieved record full-year Lower 48 and total Company production, enhanced our diverse portfolio, and progressed our global LNG strategy. [Page 4] In 2023, we delivered operationally across our diverse global portfolio with record full- year production of 1,826 MBOED. [Page 4] We continued to leverage technologies and operational excellence to improve drilling and completion efficiencies in the Lower 48 and across our assets. [Page 4] Our teams reached first production at several subsea tiebacks in Norway, Surmont Pad 267 in Canada and Bohai Phase 4B in China and achieved startup at the second phase of Montney\u2019s central processing facility in Canada. [Page 4] We opportunistically acquired the remaining 50% working interest in Surmont at an attractive price that fits our financial framework. [Page 4] Long-life, low sustaining capital assets like Surmont play an important role in our low cost of supply portfolio. [Page 4] In addition, we reached final investment decision (FID) on Willow in Alaska, where we have over 50 years as a proven, responsible operator. [Page 4] Finally, we continued to advance our global LNG strategy through expansion in Qatar, FID at Port Arthur LNG, regasification agreements in the Netherlands and offtake agreements in Mexico. [Page 4] We now have equity, offtake, and regasification agreements across major global markets. [Page 4] Second, we returned $11 billion to stockholders and maintained discipline on our cost of supply framework with a continued focus on returns on and of capital. [Page 4] Full year 2023 earnings were $11.0 billion, or $9.06 per share, and our net cash provided by operating activities totaled $20.0 billion. [Page 4] We returned $11.0 billion to stockholders through our three-tier framework, including $5.6 billion through our ordinary dividend and variable return of cash and $5.4 billion in share repurchases. [Page 4] This is in excess of our annual through- the-cycle commitment to return greater than 30% of cash provided by operating activities to stockholders. [Page 4] In addition, across our portfolio we maintained discipline on our rigorous cost of supply framework to maximize our returns on capital. [Page 4] We are resolute in our efforts S SAFETY No task is so important that we can\u2019t take the time to do it safely. [Page 4] A safe company is a successful company. [Page 4] P PEOPLE We respect one another. [Page 4] We recognize that our success depends upon the capabilities and inclusion of our employees. [Page 4] We value different voices and opinions. [Page 4] I INTEGRITY We are ethical and trustworthy in our relationships with internal and external stakeholders. [Page 4] We keep our promises. [Page 4] R RESPONSIBILITY We are accountable for our actions. [Page 4] We care about our neighbors. [Page 4] Sustainability is core to our company and creates shared value for our stakeholders. [Page 4] I INNOVATION We anticipate change and respond with creative solutions. [Page 4] We are responsive to the changing needs of the industry. [Page 4] We embrace learning. [Page 4] We are not afraid to try new things. [Page 4] T TEAMWORK We have a \u201ccan do\u201d attitude that inspires top performance from everyone. [Page 4] We encourage collaboration. [Page 4] We celebrate success. [Page 4] We win together. [Page 4] 4 ConocoPhillips [Page 5] to maximize efficiencies and optimize well construction and completions designs to increase well recovery while minimizing incremental cost of supply. [Page 5] As an example, we achieved improvement of completion pumping efficiencies by 10% to 15% across our Lower 48 business segment. [Page 5] Third, we accelerated our company\u2019s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions-intensity reduction target through 2030 and were recognized by the Oil & Gas Methane Partnership 2.0 for our methane reduction efforts. [Page 5] In 2023, we demonstrated meaningful progress toward our Plan for the Net-Zero Energy Transition, including by accelerating our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions-intensity reduction target from 40-50% to 50-60% gross operated emissions, using a 2016 baseline. [Page 5] We allocated a portion of our budget for projects to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity and advance low carbon opportunities, including carbon capture and storage. [Page 5] In addition, we are in our second year of membership in the Oil & Gas Methane Partnership 2.0 (OGMP 2.0) initiative, which seeks to improve industry transparency in methane emissions reporting and encourage progress in reducing those emissions. [Page 5] We were awarded the OGMP 2.0\u2019s Gold Standard Pathway designation in recognition of our ambitious multi-year measurement-based reporting plan which goes beyond current regulatory requirements. [Page 5] Additionally, 2023 marked the first year that Energy Transition Milestones were included as a standalone metric in our Variable Cash Incentive Program, further demonstrating our commitment to our net-zero operational emissions ambitions, by directly tying our performance on the Energy Transition Milestones to our compensation. [Page 5] Looking to the Future Now and into the future, we are focused on operational excellence with a proven track record of strong returns. [Page 5] Our strategy is differential, and we believe our portfolio is the deepest, most durable and diverse of any of our peers. [Page 5] In addition, we are well positioned for the energy transition. [Page 5] Safety remains a critical part of our culture, and we prioritize the safety of both our colleagues and communities. [Page 5] That means continuously looking for ways to operate more safely, efficiently, and responsibly, with a focus on reducing human error. [Page 5] We understand that this is a fundamental part of our license to operate. [Page 5] Your input is valued and your vote is very important. [Page 5] We strongly believe that regular engagement with all stakeholders \u2014 stockholders, employees, customers, suppliers, advocacy groups, governments, and communities \u2014 is critical to our long-term success.

[Page 8] \u2022 We delivered full year total and Lower 48 record production of 1,826 thousand barrels and 1,067 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day, respectively, while we continued to enhance our portfolio diversity by opportunistically acquiring the remaining 50% working interest in Surmont, reaching FID on the Willow project in Alaska and further progressing our global LNG strategy. [Page 8] \u2022 We achieved a 17 percent return on capital employed(1) and we delivered competitive returns of capital by distributing $11 billion to stockholders through our three-tier framework, including $5.6 billion in cash through the ordinary dividend and variable return of cash (\u201cVROC\u201d) and $5.4 billion through share repurchases. [Page 8] \u2022 We continued to demonstrate our commitment to our net-zero operational emissions ambition by accelerating our GHG emissions-intensity reduction target through 2030 from 40-50% to 50-60%(2) and we were awarded the Oil & Gas Methane Partnership 2.0 Gold Standard Pathway designation. [Page 8] We continue to be guided by our SPIRIT Values and remain committed to our foundational principles \u2014 focusing on peer-leading distributions, maintaining a strong balance sheet, executing disciplined investment, and demonstrating responsible and reliable ESG performance. [Page 8] Supporting these core principles are our strategic cash flow allocation priorities: (1) invest enough capital to sustain production and pay the existing dividend; (2) grow the dividend annually; (3) maintain \u2018A\u2019 credit rating; (4) return greater than 30 percent of cash from operations to stockholders; and (5) make disciplined investments to enhance returns.

[Page 9] Stockholder Engagement ConocoPhillips understands the importance of maintaining a robust stockholder engagement program. [Page 9] During 2023, ConocoPhillips continued this long-standing practice. [Page 9] Executives and management from our investor relations, sustainable development, human resources, government affairs, and legal groups routinely engaged with stockholders on a variety of topics, including our strategy and value proposition, corporate governance, executive compensation, human capital management, culture, climate change, and sustainability. [Page 9] When appropriate, directors also met with stockholders. [Page 9] We spoke with representatives from our top institutional investors, mutual funds, public pension funds, labor unions, and socially responsible funds to hear their views on these important topics. [Page 9] Overall, investors expressed strong support for ConocoPhillips. [Page 9] We believe our regular stockholder engagement was productive and provided an open exchange of ideas and perspectives for both ConocoPhillips and our stockholders.

[Page 14] Our commitment to these efforts is demonstrated by our achievements made to date \u2014 many of which have been completed ahead of schedule. [Page 14] As we achieve our goals, we fine- tune our strategy and refine our commitments through ongoing engagement with our key stakeholders. [Page 14] The table below provides an update on how we are progressing against our Plan, including demonstrating our progress and achievements in maintaining strategic flexibility, reducing Scope 1 and 2 emissions, addressing Scope 3 emissions and contributing to the energy transition. [Page 14] 2023 PROGRESS REPORT STRATEGIC FLEXIBILITY Portfolio and Scenario Analysis \u2022 Continued focus on resilient low cost of supply and low GHG intensity resources that meet energy transition pathway demand. [Page 14] \u2022 Published a new net-zero scenario modeling the collective global government and societal actions that would be required to align with limiting warming to 1.5 degrees. [Page 14] REDUCING SCOPE 1 AND 2 EMISSIONS Methane \u2022 Reduced methane intensity by ~70% since 2015. [Page 14] \u2022 Progressing toward near-zero methane intensity by 2030 (1.5 kg CO2e\/BOE or approximately 0.15% of natural gas produced). [Page 14] \u2022 Participated in OGMP 2.0 to improve methane measurement and reporting transparency and achieved the Gold Standard Pathway for emissions reporting. [Page 14] \u2022 Invested in LongPath Technologies, a scalable laser-based continuous emissions monitoring solution with the potential to cover targeted assets or provide basin-wide multi-operator coverage. [Page 14] Flaring \u2022 On schedule to meet the World Bank Zero Routine Flaring goal by the end of 2025.(1) \u2022 Developing total flaring intensity target for 2030. [Page 14] Overall GHG \u2022 Accelerated our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions intensity reduction target through 2030 from 40-50% to 50- 60%, using a 2016 baseline for both gross operated and net equity emissions. [Page 14] \u2022 Completed our approved Scope 1 and 2 emissions reductions projects and advanced low carbon opportunities within the allotted capital and cost budget. [Page 14] \u2022 Participated in a Ceres-led Roundtable to discuss solutions for reaching net-zero emissions with cross- sector participation from the financial sector and exploration and production (E&P) oil and gas companies. [Page 14] \u2022 Expanded third-party limited assurance to all sustainability disclosures in our Sustainability Report. [Page 14] \u2022 Continued to strengthen sustainability reporting processes, controls and assurance to prepare for pending disclosure requirements.

[Page 14] Offsets \u2022 Developed guidelines for company participation in the voluntary carbon market including due diligence requirements. [Page 14] \u2022 Increased our investment in the Climate Asset Management Carbon Fund. [Page 14] \u2022 Continued to evaluate a wide range of future offset projects and funds to possibly diversify our portfolio. [Page 14] (1) Per the World Bank\u2019s Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 Initiative Text, \u201cOil companies that endorse the Initiative will develop new oil fields they operate according to plans that incorporate sustainable utilization or conservation of the field\u2019s associated gas without routine flaring. [Page 14] Oil companies with routine flaring at existing oil fields they operate will seek to implement economically viable solutions to eliminate this legacy flaring as soon as possible, and no later than 2030.\u201d 14 ConocoPhillips",

[Page 15] We acknowledge the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that GHG emissions from the use of fossil fuels contribute to increases in global temperatures. [Page 15] We acknowledge the importance that science places on limiting global average temperature increases to below 2-degree Celsius compared to pre-industrial times, and to achieve that, science shows that global GHG emissions need to reach net-zero in the second half of this century. [Page 15] We support the Paris Agreement as a welcomed global policy response to that challenge. [Page 15] We have had a public global climate change position since 2003. [Page 15] The position is reviewed periodically, agreed to by the Executive Leadership Team, and then recommended to the Board. [Page 15] 15 2024 Proxy Statement Progress Report on Our Plan for the Net-Zero Energy Transition [Page 16] Item 1: Election of Directors and Director Biographies What am I Voting On? [Page 16] You are voting on a proposal to elect the 12 nominees named in this Proxy Statement to one-year terms as ConocoPhillips directors. [Page 16] What is the makeup of the Board of Directors and how often are the members elected? [Page 16] Our Board currently has 12 members. [Page 16] Directors are elected at the annual stockholder meeting each year. [Page 16] Any vacancy on the Board created between annual stockholder meetings (if, for example, a current director resigns or the size of the Board is increased) may be filled by a majority vote of the remaining directors then in office. [Page 16] Any director appointed to fill a vacancy would hold office until the next election. [Page 16] Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, directors generally may not stand for reelection after they reach the age of 72. [Page 16] What if a nominee is unable or unwilling to serve? [Page 16] All director nominees have consented to serve. [Page 16] However, should a director become unable or unwilling to serve before the date of the Annual Meeting and should the Board not elect to reduce the size of the Board, shares represented by proxies may be voted for a substitute nominated by the Board. [Page 16] How are directors compensated? [Page 16] Please see our discussion of director compensation beginning on page 53. [Page 16] How are nominees selected? [Page 16] The Committee on Directors\u2019 Affairs regularly evaluates the size and composition of the Board and continually assesses whether the composition appropriately relates to ConocoPhillips\u2019 strategic needs, which change as the business environment evolves. [Page 16] We seek director candidates who possess the highest personal and professional ethics, integrity, and values and who are committed to representing the long-term interest of all ConocoPhillips\u2019 stakeholders. [Page 16] As some directors approach retirement age, the Committee on Directors\u2019 Affairs seeks to onboard new directors to backfill the needed skills and experience of outgoing directors with sufficient overlap in service to allow for the transfer of institutional knowledge and sharing of experiences. [Page 16] 16 ConocoPhillips [Page 17] The chart below shows our process for identifying and integrating new directors. [Page 17] HOW WE SELECT AND ONBOARD\/INTEGRATE NEW BOARD MEMBERS Board assesses its current composition and identifies skills or characteristics needed to enhance its effectiveness, considering things like: \u2022 the company\u2019s strategy \u2022 current director tenure \u2022 established retirement age \u2022 results of evaluations Candidates suggested by: \u2022 non- employee directors \u2022 stockholders \u2022 outside search firms \u2022 management Pool of candidates vetted based on: \u2022 qualifications \u2022 leadership experience \u2022 integrity, ethics, and judgment \u2022 diversity \u2022 independence \u2022 competing obligations and potential conflicts \u2022 mix of skills already on the Board Committee on Directors\u2019 Affairs interviews promising candidates and recommends nominees to the full Board Board nominates candidates for election at next annual meeting or elects new members to serve until stockholders vote at next annual meeting New directors undergo orientation and training Members of the Board provide self- evaluations and evaluations of the full Board and committees Our Corporate Governance Guidelines contain director independence standards consistent with the standards prescribed in the NYSE Listed Company Manual and provide that, at all times, at least a substantial majority of the Board must meet those standards. [Page 17] The Committee on Directors\u2019 Affairs also seeks to ensure that the Board reflects a range of talents, ages, skills, personal attributes, and expertise \u2014 particularly in the areas of leadership and management, financial reporting, issues specific to oil- and gas-related industries, both domestic and international markets, public policy and government regulation, technology, public company board service, human capital management, and environmental and sustainability matters \u2014 sufficient to provide sound and prudent guidance with respect to ConocoPhillips\u2019 strategic needs. [Page 17] The Board seeks to maintain a diverse membership and also requires that its members be able to dedicate the time and resources necessary to ensure the diligent performance of their duties, including attending Board and applicable committee meetings. [Page 17] To that end, the Committee on Directors\u2019 Affairs considers the number of other boards on which each candidate already serves. [Page 17] Non-employee directors may not serve on more than four other boards of publicly-traded companies in addition to the Board, and ConocoPhillips' Chief Executive Officer may not serve on the board of more than one other publicly-traded company. [Page 17] Directors should seek approval from the Chair of the Board and the Chair of the Committee on Directors\u2019 Affairs in advance of accepting an invitation to serve on another public company board. [Page 17] 17 2024 Proxy Statement Item 1: Election of Directors and Director Biographies [Page 18] The following are some of the key qualifications and skills the Committee on Directors\u2019 Affairs considered in evaluating the director nominees. [Page 18] The chart on the next page shows how these qualifications and skills are distributed among our nominees. [Page 18] The individual biographies beginning on page 21 provide additional information about how each nominee\u2019s specific experiences, qualifications, and skills align with and further the strategic direction of ConocoPhillips. [Page 18] CEO OR SENIOR OFFICER FINANCIAL REPORTING INDUSTRY We believe that directors with CEO or senior officer experience provide valuable insights. [Page 18] These individuals have a demonstrated record of leadership and a practical understanding of organizations, processes, strategy, risk and risk management, and the methods to drive change and growth. [Page 18] Through their service as top leaders at other companies, they also bring valuable perspectives on common issues affecting large and complex organizations. [Page 18] We measure operating and strategic performance by reference to financial targets. [Page 18] In addition, accurate financial reporting and robust auditing are critical to ConocoPhillips\u2019 success. [Page 18] Accordingly, we seek to have a number of directors who could qualify as audit committee financial experts (as defined by SEC rules), and we expect all of our directors to be financially knowledgeable. [Page 18] We also believe it is important to have knowledge and experience in capital markets, both debt and equity, given our position as a large publicly traded company. [Page 18] We seek to have directors with significant experience in the energy industry. [Page 18] These directors have valuable perspective on issues specific to our business. [Page 18] GLOBAL REGULATORY\/GOVERNMENT TECHNOLOGY As a global energy company, our future success depends, in part, on how we grow our businesses outside the United States. [Page 18] Directors with global business or international experience provide valued perspectives on our operations. [Page 18] The perspectives of directors who have experience within the regulatory field are important. [Page 18] The energy industry is heavily regulated and directly affected by governmental actions and decisions, and we believe that directors with government experience offer valuable insight in this regard. [Page 18] Experience or expertise in information technology helps us pursue and achieve our business objectives. [Page 18] Leadership and understanding of technology, cybersecurity risk, cloud computing, scalable data analytics, and big data technologies add exceptional value to our Board as we increasingly utilize our global data assets to monitor and optimize our operations. [Page 18] PUBLIC COMPANY BOARD SERVICE ENVIRONMENTAL\/ SUSTAINABILITY HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT ConocoPhillips aspires to the highest standards of corporate governance and ethical conduct. [Page 18] Service on the boards and board committees of other large, publicly traded companies provides an understanding of corporate governance practices and trends and insights into: (1) board management; (2) relations between the Board, the CEO, and senior management; (3) agenda setting; and (4) succession planning. [Page 18] We believe this experience supports our goals of strong board and management accountability, transparency, and protection of stockholder interests. [Page 18] Our sustainable development approach is integrated into ConocoPhillips\u2019 planning and decision-making. [Page 18] Directors who have experience with sustainability, including through leadership roles in our industry, strengthen the Board\u2019s oversight and ensure that strategic business essentials and long-term value creation for stockholders are achieved with a responsible, sustainable business model which fosters a stable and healthy environment for tomorrow and proactively addresses stakeholder interests. [Page 18] We could not execute our differential strategy without employees, which is why we value directors with experience in effectively engaging, developing, retaining, and rewarding employees and with experience in diversity, equity, and inclusion management.

[Page 20] Stockholders are also welcomed to recommend director candidates for consideration. [Page 20] If you wish to recommend a candidate for nomination to the Board, please follow the procedures described under \u201cSubmission of Future Stockholder Proposals and Nominations\u201d on page 129 for nominations made directly by a stockholder. [Page 20] Candidates recommended by stockholders are evaluated on the same basis as all other candidates. [Page 20] What vote is required to approve this proposal? [Page 20] Each nominee requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting; the number of votes cast \u201cfor\u201d a director must exceed the number of votes cast \u201cagainst\u201d that director. [Page 20] In a contested election (if the number of nominees exceeded the number of directors to be elected), directors would be elected by a plurality of the shares represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors. [Page 20] What if a Director Nominee does not receive a majority of the votes cast? [Page 20] If a nominee who is serving as a director is not elected at the Annual Meeting and no one else is elected in place of that director, then, under Delaware law, the director continues to serve on the Board as a \u201choldover director.\u201d However, under our By-Laws, a holdover director is required to tender a resignation to the Board. [Page 20] The Committee on Directors\u2019 Affairs then would consider the resignation and recommend to the Board whether to accept or reject it or whether some other action should be taken. [Page 20] The Board would then make a decision, without participation by the holdover director. [Page 20] The Board is required to disclose publicly (by a news release, filing with the SEC, or other broadly disseminated means of communication) its decision regarding the tendered resignation and the rationale behind that decision within 90 days from the date the election results are certified. [Page 20] 20 ConocoPhillips Item 1: Election of Directors and Director Biographies [Page 21] Who are this year\u2019s Director Nominees? [Page 21] The following 12 directors are standing for election to hold office until the 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. [Page 21] Each of the director nominees is a current director. [Page 21] Committee membership is effective as of May 13, 2024. [Page 21] Dennis V. [Page 21] Arriola Former Chief Executive Officer, Avangrid, Inc. [Page 21] Age: 63 Director Since: September 2022 ConocoPhillips Committees: Audit and Finance Committee Human Resources and Compensation Committee Mr. [Page 21] Arriola is an Operating Partner at Sandbrook Capital. [Page 21] He previously served as Chief Executive Officer of Avangrid, Inc. [Page 21] from 2020 until 2022.

[Page 32] 32 ConocoPhillips Item 1: Election of Directors and Director Biographies [Page 33] Board Composition and Refreshment We are continuously evaluating the overall balance of the Board, including between longer-tenured directors with great institutional knowledge and new directors with fresh external viewpoints. [Page 33] When considering candidates to fill a vacancy on the Board, the priority is finding a candidate with the necessary skills and qualifications. [Page 33] In addition, we believe the Board benefits from diversity of race, ethnicity, gender, age, education, skills, cultural background, and professional experiences. [Page 33] While our Board consists of diverse members, one of our longstanding female directors recently retired and another longstanding female director resigned to more fully pursue other commitments. [Page 33] These recent departures have resulted in less gender diversity in the Board's current composition, which it is actively seeking to improve. [Page 33] In 2023, the Board undertook a search for qualified female candidates that could bring the right skills and experience to enhance the Board\u2019s composition. [Page 33] A number of candidates have been reviewed and considered, and we are in the process of selecting the right individual, including advanced discussions with one candidate. [Page 33] A great deal of rigor and care is put into the Board refreshment process, which requires time for director selection and onboarding. [Page 33] Nonetheless, we are committed to onboarding at least one new female director by the end of 2024. [Page 33] As part of our Board\u2019s commitment to regular renewal and refreshment: \u2022 The Committee on Directors\u2019 Affairs routinely and on an ongoing basis assesses the Board\u2019s composition, taking into consideration any planned retirements for the Board, as well as background and diversity (including gender, ethnicity, race, national origin, and geographic background); \u2022 We have implemented an annual Board and Committee assessment process; and \u2022 We have adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines that state that directors generally may not stand for re-election after they reach the age of 72. [Page 33] Five of the 12 director nominees have joined the Board in the past 5 years. [Page 33] Almost 42 percent of our director nominees are women or racially\/ ethnically diverse individuals. [Page 33] The average age of our director nominees is 63 and the average tenure of our director nominees is 6 years.

[Page 34] New Director Orientation The orientation program is tailored to the needs of each new director depending on his or her level of experience serving on other boards and knowledge of ConocoPhillips and the oil and gas industry. [Page 34] Materials provided to new directors include information on ConocoPhillips\u2019 strategic plans, financial matters, corporate governance practices, Code of Business Ethics and Conduct, and other key policies and practices. [Page 34] The onboarding process includes a series of meetings with members of senior management and their staff for deep-dive briefings on ConocoPhillips\u2019 operations and financial strategies and SPIRIT Values. [Page 34] In addition, the orientation program includes a visit to ConocoPhillips\u2019 headquarters, and to the extent practicable, certain significant facilities. [Page 34] Continuing Director Education Continuing director education is provided during portions of Board and committee meetings and is focused on topics necessary to assist them in fulfilling their duties, including regular reviews of compliance and corporate governance developments; business-specific learning opportunities through site visits and Board meetings; and briefing sessions on topics that present special risks and opportunities to ConocoPhillips. [Page 34] Education often takes the form of \u201cwhite papers\u201d covering timely subjects or topics. [Page 34] As part of the Board\u2019s annual evaluation process, directors are asked to identify areas where they feel continuing education would be helpful. [Page 34] Director Education Seminars Directors may attend educational seminars and programs sponsored by external organizations. [Page 34] ConocoPhillips covers the reasonable expenses for a director\u2019s participation in outside continuing education approved by the Committee on Directors\u2019 Affairs. [Page 34] 34 ConocoPhillips Item 1: Election of Directors and Director Biographies [Page 35] Board and Committee Evaluations Each year, the Board performs a rigorous full Board evaluation, and each director performs a self-evaluation and an evaluation of each of his or her peers. [Page 35] Generally, the evaluation process described below is managed by the Corporate Secretary\u2019s office with oversight by the Committee on Directors\u2019 Affairs. [Page 35] However, the Committee on Directors\u2019 Affairs periodically retains an independent third party to manage the evaluation process to ensure it remains as thorough and transparent as possible. [Page 35] 1 EVALUATION QUESTIONNAIRES \u2022 Formal opportunity for directors to identify potential improvements \u2022 Solicit candid feedback from each director regarding the performance and effectiveness of the Board, its committees, and individual directors 2 INDIVIDUAL INTERVIEWS \u2022 Lead Director has an in-depth conversation with each member of the Board 3 REVIEW OF FEEDBACK \u2022 Lead Director reviews questionnaire and interview responses with Committee on Directors\u2019 Affairs \u2022 Lead Director reviews questionnaire and interview responses with full Board in executive session 4 USE OF FEEDBACK \u2022 The Committee on Directors\u2019 Affairs develops recommendations \u2022 The Committee on Directors\u2019 Affairs and the Lead Director identify areas for improvement of individual directors and of the Board as a whole \u2022 The Committee on Directors\u2019 Affairs uses the results of individual director evaluations as a part of the nomination process for the next annual meeting 5 \u0007CHANGES IMPLEMENTED \u2022 As a result of this evaluation process, the Board has strengthened its structure and procedures in the following ways over the past few years: \u2013 achieved successful transitions of committee leadership roles; \u2013 provided more materials as pre-read to improve efficiencies at meetings and allow more time for discussion and deliberation; \u2013 more robust committee reports to the full Board; \u2013 individual director coaching; and \u2013 added new highly skilled directors to enhance the Board\u2019s composition. [Page 35] In addition to participating in the full Board evaluation, members of each committee also complete a detailed questionnaire annually to evaluate how well the committee is operating and to suggest improvements. [Page 35] Each committee\u2019s Chair summarizes the responses and reviews them with the members of his or her respective committee. [Page 35] The Committee on Directors\u2019 Affairs reviews these evaluation processes annually and develops any changes it deems necessary to maintain best practices. [Page 35] 35 2024 Proxy Statement Item 1: Election of Directors and Director Biographies [Page 36] Corporate Governance at ConocoPhillips The Committee on Directors\u2019 Affairs and our Board annually review our governance structure, taking into account any changes in Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) and New York Stock Exchange (the \u201cNYSE\u201d) rules, as well as current best practices. [Page 36] Our Corporate Governance Guidelines address the matters shown below, among others. [Page 36] \u2022 Director qualifications \u2022 Director responsibilities \u2022 Board committees \u2022 Director access to officers, employees, and independent advisors \u2022 Director compensation and stock ownership requirements \u2022 Director orientation and continuing education \u2022 Chief Executive Officer evaluation and management succession planning \u2022 Board performance evaluations The Corporate Governance Guidelines are posted on our website under \u201cInvestors > Corporate Governance\u201d and are available in print upon request (see \u201cAvailable Information and Q&A about the Annual Meeting and Voting\u201d beginning on page 130). [Page 36] Board Leadership Structure BOARD OVERVIEW \u2022 Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Ryan M. [Page 36] Lance \u2022 Lead Director: Robert A. [Page 36] Niblock \u2022 Active engagement by all directors \u2022 Ten of our 12 director nominees are independent \u2022 All members of the Audit and Finance Committee, Human Resources and Compensation Committee, Public Policy and Sustainability Committee, and Committee on Directors\u2019 Affairs are independent Annual Evaluation of Leadership Structure and Annual Election of Independent Lead Director ConocoPhillips believes that independent board oversight is an essential component of strong corporate performance and enhances stockholder value. [Page 36] The Board believes there is no single organizational model that is the best and most effective in all circumstances. [Page 36] As a result, the Board periodically considers whether the offices of Chairman and CEO should be combined or separated and who should serve in such capacities. [Page 36] Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, our Board chooses its Chairman based on what is in the best interest of ConocoPhillips and our stockholders. [Page 36] The Chairman and CEO may, but need not, be the same person. [Page 36] As part of its annual review and evaluation process, the Board reviews its leadership structure and whether combining or separating the roles of Chairman and CEO is in the best interest of ConocoPhillips and our stockholders. [Page 36] Our Corporate Governance Guidelines require that, in the event the Board determines that it is in the best interest of ConocoPhillips and its stockholders for the offices of Chairman and CEO to be held by the same person (or in the event the office of Chairman is not held by the CEO, but is nonetheless not independent), an independent lead director must be selected from among the non-employee directors. [Page 36] The Board will continue to reexamine its corporate governance policies and leadership structures on an ongoing basis to ensure that they continue to meet our needs. [Page 36] For the 2023 Proxy Statement, we received a stockholder proposal asking stockholders to vote in favor of requiring the Board of Directors to amend the governing documents, as necessary, to separate the role of CEO and Chairman. [Page 36] After evaluating the proposal, the Committee on Directors\u2019 Affairs determined that it is in the best interest of ConocoPhillips and its stockholders to maintain flexibility in our governing documents to allow the Board of Directors to determine what organizational model best serves the interest of our company and its stockholders. [Page 36] The proposal failed to receive significant support in 2023, with only approximately 25% of stockholders indicating support for the proposal as submitted. [Page 36] During engagements in 2023, stockholders were interested in learning about our leadership structure, and appreciated hearing about how our board has the responsibility to review the governance structure on a regular and ongoing basis, allowing for adaptability. [Page 36] Stockholders expressed support for the Board of Directors continuing to evaluate whether the combined role of Chairman and CEO is in the best interest of the Company. [Page 36] 36 ConocoPhillips [Page 37] Why We Believe in Our Leadership Structure In 2023, the Board reviewed our leadership structure and determined that continuing with a combined Chairman and CEO, with our independent Lead Director, continues to be in the best interest of ConocoPhillips and our stockholders. [Page 37] The Board believes its current structure and processes ensure our Chairman and CEO is in a position to guide the Board in setting priorities for ConocoPhillips and in addressing the risks and challenges we face, while also providing for robust, effective, and independent oversight of management by the Board and our independent Lead Director. [Page 37] Ryan M. [Page 37] Lance Chairman and Chief Executive Officer \u2022 Possesses extensive knowledge and deep understanding of the business and challenges we face \u2022 Facilitates timely deliberation by the Board of items of the highest priority through his day-to-day insight into our challenges and opportunities \u2022 Promotes unity and reliability through consistent leadership direction internally and externally \u2022 Serves as a bridge between the Board and management, promoting collaboration while ensuring oversight \u2022 Positioned to most effectively execute the strategy for the business to maximize stockholder value \u2022 Proven successful in leading ConocoPhillips through business cycles and major transactions, including subsequent integration of acquired businesses Robert A. [Page 37] Niblock Lead Director (Since May 2019) \u2022 Extensive experience serving on public company boards provides strong background in corporate governance \u2022 Deep understanding of our business and extensive amounts of institutional knowledge having served as an active director since 2010, including rotations on all of the Committees of the Board \u2022 Respected by management and the other Directors, promoting a collaborative environment for decision-making, while enabling strong oversight of executive leadership \u2022 Strong working relationship with our Chairman and CEO \u2022 Deeply invested in ensuring the effectiveness and independence of the Board, holding in-depth conversations with each Director as part of the annual evaluation process The Board consists of ten independent directors. [Page 37] Furthermore, each of the Audit and Finance, Human Resources and Compensation, and Directors\u2019 Affairs committees is made up entirely of independent directors. [Page 37] The Chairs of the Board\u2019s committees establish their agendas and review their committee materials in advance of meetings, conferring with other directors and members of management as each deems appropriate. [Page 37] Moreover, each director is free to suggest agenda items and to raise matters that are not on the agenda at Board and committee meetings. [Page 37] Our Corporate Governance Guidelines require our Lead Director to preside over an executive session of the non-employee directors at every meeting. [Page 37] Each executive session may include a discussion of the performance of the Chairman and CEO, matters concerning the relationship of the Board with the Chairman and CEO and other members of senior management, and such other matters as the non-employee directors deem appropriate. [Page 37] In addition, our Lead Director presides over a meeting of our independent directors at least once a year as required by the NYSE rules. [Page 37] No formal action of the Board is taken at these meetings, although the non-employee directors may subsequently recommend matters for consideration by the full Board. [Page 37] The Board may invite guest attendees for the purpose of making presentations, responding to questions by the directors, or providing counsel on specific matters within their areas of expertise.

[Page 38] Board Independence The Corporate Governance Guidelines contain director independence standards that are consistent with the standards set forth in the NYSE Listed Company Manual to assist the Board in determining the independence of ConocoPhillips\u2019 non-employee directors. [Page 38] Under such standards, the Board has determined that all non-employee directors meet the standards regarding independence set forth in the Corporate Governance Guidelines and are free of any material relationship with ConocoPhillips (either directly or indirectly as a partner, stockholder, or officer of an organization that has a relationship with ConocoPhillips). [Page 38] In making such determination, the Board specifically considered the fact that many of our directors may be directors, retired officers, and stockholders of companies with which we conduct business. [Page 38] In addition, some of our directors may serve as employees of, or consultants or advisors to, companies that do business with ConocoPhillips and its affiliates. [Page 38] In all cases, the Board determined that the nature of the business conducted and the interest of the director by virtue of such position were immaterial both to ConocoPhillips and to the director. [Page 38] In recommending that each non-employee director is independent, our Board, with input from the Committee on Directors\u2019 Affairs, considered relationships that, while not constituting related-party transactions in which a director had a direct or indirect material interest, nonetheless involved transactions between ConocoPhillips and a company with which a director is affiliated, whether through employment status or by virtue of serving as a director. [Page 38] Included in the Committee\u2019s review were the following transactions, which occurred in the ordinary course of business. [Page 38] In all instances, it was determined that the nature of the business conducted and the dollar amounts involved were immaterial, both to ConocoPhillips and the relevant counterparty, and fell within independence standards set forth in the ConocoPhillips Corporate Governance Guidelines and the NYSE Listed Company Manual.

[Page 39] A Reportable Related Party Transaction is a transaction, arrangement, or relationship (or series of similar transactions, arrangements, or relationships) in which: \u2022 We (or one of our subsidiaries) was, is or will be a participant; \u2022 The aggregate amount involved exceeds $120,000 in any fiscal year; and \u2022 Any person who is, or at any time since the beginning of ConocoPhillips\u2019 last fiscal year was, an executive officer, director, director nominee, or holder of at least 5 percent of our equity securities (each a \u201cCovered Person\u201d), or any of such Covered Person\u2019s immediate family members, had, has, or will have a direct or indirect material interest. [Page 39] In accordance with the Related Party Transaction Policy, Covered Persons are required to identify business and financial affiliations involving themselves or their immediate family members that could reasonably be expected to give rise to a Reportable Related Party Transaction. [Page 39] Based on this information, our legal staff, in consultation with the finance team, performs the necessary diligence to determine whether any such Reportable Related Party Transaction exists or will exist, once completed. [Page 39] Upon determining that a transaction is or will be a Reportable Related Party Transaction, the General Counsel presents all relevant facts and circumstances to the Audit and Finance Committee, which reviews transactions for materiality and determines whether the transaction is in the best interest of ConocoPhillips, before either approving or disapproving it. [Page 39] In making its decision, the Audit and Finance Committee considers whether the transaction is on terms comparable to those that could be obtained in arm\u2019s-length dealings with an unrelated third party and the extent of the Covered Person\u2019s interest in the transaction, taking into account the conflicts of interest provisions of ConocoPhillips\u2019 Code of Business Ethics and Conduct and such other factors as it believes are relevant. [Page 39] The Audit and Finance Committee shall prohibit any transactions that it determines are inconsistent with the interests of ConocoPhillips and its stockholders. [Page 39] The Audit and Finance Committee approved the following Reportable Related Party Transactions: Cameron J. [Page 39] Smith, son-in-law of William L. [Page 39] Bullock, Jr., our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, was employed in a non-executive position. [Page 39] The aggregate value of the compensation paid to Mr. [Page 39] Smith during fiscal year 2023 was approximately $346,312, consisting of salary, annual incentive (earned in fiscal 2023 and paid in fiscal 2024), and restricted stock unit awards. [Page 39] In addition, Mr. [Page 39] Smith received the standard benefits provided to other non- executive ConocoPhillips employees for his services during fiscal year 2023. [Page 39] Timothy A. [Page 39] Leach serves as a director and also an employee of the company, but not as an executive officer. [Page 39] Mr. [Page 39] Leach receives compensation from the company for the services he provides as an employee. [Page 39] Mr. [Page 39] Leach does not receive any additional compensation for his service as a director. [Page 39] The compensation he received as an employee is summarized in footnote 1 beginning on page 55.

[Page 40] Each director attended at least 75 percent of the aggregate of the Board and applicable committee meetings held in 2023. [Page 40] The Board has five standing committees: (1) the Executive Committee; (2) the Audit and Finance Committee; (3) the Human Resources and Compensation Committee; (4) the Committee on Directors\u2019 Affairs; and (5) the Public Policy and Sustainability Committee. [Page 40] The Board determined that all of the members of the Audit and Finance Committee, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee, the Public Policy and Sustainability Committee, and the Committee on Directors\u2019 Affairs are independent directors within the meaning of SEC regulations, the listing standards of the NYSE, and ConocoPhillips\u2019 Corporate Governance Guidelines. [Page 40] Each committee, other than the Executive Committee, conducts an annual self-evaluation as described under \u201cBoard and Committee Evaluations\u201d on page 35.

[Page 43] \u2022 ConocoPhillips has a dedicated Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) who is responsible for overseeing the cybersecurity program and works with a cybersecurity team, including Directors of IT and OT Security Architecture and a Manager of Cyber Security Operations Center (CSOC), who is responsible for detection, investigation, and response to cybersecurity incidents (collectively, the \u201cIT\/OT Security Team\u201d). [Page 43] \u2022 The IT\/OT Security Team has a CSOC Incident Handling Process and a Computer Security Incident Response Plan (CSIRP), which govern the Company\u2019s response to cybersecurity incidents. [Page 43] These processes and plans include escalation based on a defined incident categorization to the CISO, senior managers and other cybersecurity program stakeholders, including senior leadership, the Audit and Finance Committee, and internal and external legal advisors. [Page 43] \u2022 In addition to a CSIRP, ConocoPhillips maintains a robust set of IT\/OT Security policies, standards, and procedures to govern our program and to identify, assess, and mitigate the risks and effects of, and recover from, cyber-related threats. [Page 43] These policies and procedures are reviewed and updated regularly to help protect and enhance our security posture.

[Page 43] 43 2024 Proxy Statement Corporate Governance at ConocoPhillips [Page 44] Managing Climate-Related Risks As we manage through the energy transition, oil and natural gas will remain an essential part of the energy supply mix in a low-carbon world, and flexibility and resilience will be required to ensure that supply. [Page 44] In 2020, we adopted a climate-related risk framework with an ambition to reduce our operational (Scope 1 and 2) emissions to net-zero by 2050. [Page 44] The objective of our Climate Risk Strategy is to manage climate-related risk, optimize opportunities and equip the company to respond to changes in key uncertainties, including government policies around the world, emissions reduction technologies, alternative energy technologies and changes in consumer trends. [Page 44] Scenario analysis is an important aspect of our strategic planning process that enables us to: \u2022 Gain a better understanding of external factors that impact our business; \u2022 Identify leading indicators and trends; \u2022 Test the robustness of our strategy across different business environments; \u2022 Communicate risks appropriately; and \u2022 Inform how we position our business as technologies and markets evolve. [Page 44] Combined with our focus on developing the lowest cost of supply resources and low GHG intensity assets, we believe our climate risk framework is the most effective way for our company to sustainably compete in the energy transition. [Page 44] Managing Nature-Related Risks Our activities and operations can contribute to nature-related risks including resource use through freshwater withdrawal or consumption and land-use change through infrastructure footprint resulting in habitat disturbance, reduced habitat intactness and impacts on species distribution. [Page 44] Fresh water is a limited resource in regions experiencing water scarcity, and local availability may be affected in the future by physical effects of climate change, such as droughts. [Page 44] We manage water risks and mitigate potential impacts to water resources locally, taking into account the unique social, economic, and environmental conditions of each basin or offshore marine area. [Page 44] Biodiversity loss is a global challenge that requires local mitigation solutions. [Page 44] We manage risks and mitigate impacts to areas with biological or cultural significance using the Mitigation Hierarchy. [Page 44] We support habitat and species conservation through strategic and proactive conservation initiatives in collaboration with conservation partners. [Page 44] Managing Social-Related Risks We engage with local stakeholders \u2014 those who may impact or be impacted by our business \u2014 to understand their values and interests, reduce the impact of operations and proposed projects, and support economic and community development opportunities. [Page 44] We seek solutions that create mutually beneficial relationships and build long-term value for both the company and our stakeholders. [Page 44] Managing Succession Planning Risks Management succession planning is a fundamental and ongoing part of the Board's responsibilities and is reviewed by the full Board annually. [Page 44] In addition, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee reviews and reports to the Board annually on the succession-planning process for the CEO and senior management for normal course of business, both short- and long-term, and in situations for which the CEO or senior management unexpectedly becomes unable to perform the responsibilities of their positions. [Page 44] Our robust, evergreen process ensures we have the right talent in place to deliver on our strategy. [Page 44] 44 ConocoPhillips Corporate Governance at ConocoPhillips [Page 45] Stockholder Engagement and Board Responsiveness ConocoPhillips is committed to engaging in constructive and meaningful conversations with stockholders and to building and managing long-term relationships based on mutual trust and respect. [Page 45] The Board values the input and insights of our stockholders and believes that consistent and effective Board-stockholder communication strengthens the Board\u2019s role as an active, informed, and engaged fiduciary. [Page 45] Board Oversight of Engagement In an effort to continuously improve ConocoPhillips\u2019 governance processes and communications, the Committee on Directors\u2019 Affairs has adopted Board and Shareholder Communication and Engagement Guidelines. [Page 45] Recognizing that director attendance at the annual meeting provides stockholders with a valuable opportunity to communicate with Board members, we expect directors to attend. [Page 45] In 2023, all of the directors standing for reelection participated in the annual meeting. [Page 45] We anticipate that all of the director nominees will participate in the Annual Meeting in May. [Page 45] We also support an open and transparent process for stockholders and other interested parties to contact the Board in between annual meetings as noted under \u201cCommunications with the Board of Directors\u201d on page 53. [Page 45] THE BOARD-DRIVEN STOCKHOLDER ENGAGEMENT PROCESS DELIBERATE, ASSESS, AND PREPARE The Board regularly assesses and monitors investor sentiment, stockholder voting results, and trends in governance, executive compensation, human capital management, culture, regulatory, environmental, social, and other matters. [Page 45] With that foundation, the Board identifies and prioritizes potential topics for stockholder engagement. [Page 45] REACH OUT AND ENGAGE Management regularly meets with stockholders to actively solicit input on a range of issues and reports stockholder views to our Board. [Page 45] With management\u2019s assistance, and when appropriate, members of the Board will engage in dialogue with stockholders, which clarifies and deepens the Board\u2019s understanding of stockholder concerns and provides stockholders with insight into our Board\u2019s processes. [Page 45] EVALUATE AND RESPOND Stockholder input informs our Board\u2019s ongoing process of continually improving governance and other practices. [Page 45] Specifically, the Board and management regularly review stockholder input to evaluate any identified issues and concerns. [Page 45] The Board responds to stockholders, as appropriate, with continued discussion and enhancements to policy, practices, and disclosure. [Page 45] 45 2024 Proxy Statement Corporate Governance at ConocoPhillips [Page 46] Ongoing Engagement and Board Reporting Executives and management from ConocoPhillips\u2019 investor relations, sustainable development, human resources, government affairs, and legal groups and, when appropriate, directors meet with stockholders regularly on a variety of topics. [Page 46] Management provides reports to the Board and its committees regarding the key themes and results of these conversations, including typical investor concerns and questions, emerging issues, and pertinent corporate governance matters. [Page 46] In 2023, we actively reached out to investors owning more than 50 percent of our stock to invite them to participate in in-depth discussions with our engagement team. [Page 46] We gained valuable feedback during these discussions, which was shared with the Board and its relevant committees. [Page 46] Board Responsiveness Our Board is committed to constructive engagement with investors. [Page 46] We regularly evaluate and respond to the views expressed by our stockholders. [Page 46] This dialogue has led to enhancements in our corporate governance, environmental, social, and executive compensation activities that the Board believes are in the best interest of ConocoPhillips and our stockholders. [Page 46] We contacted stockholders representing over We held meetings with stockholders representing approximately 50% of shares outstanding 40% of shares outstanding 80% of our institutional base Our 2023 Governance Leadership Team \u2022 Vice President, Investor Relations \u2022 Vice President, Sustainable Development \u2022 Managing Director, Climate Risk \u2022 General Manager, Compensation and Benefits \u2022 Chief Diversity Officer \u2022 General Manager, HR \u2022 Vice President & Deputy General Counsel, Corporate & Tech\/IP \u2022 Independent Lead Director, Robert A.

[Page 47] \u2022 Several stockholders asked questions on recent acquisition and divestiture activity, including potential impacts to ESG-related targets. [Page 47] Sustainability \u2022 Stockholders supported our climate strategy and appreciated hearing how we were progressing against our Plan for the Net- Zero Energy Transition. [Page 47] See \u201cProgress Report on Our Plan for the Net-Zero Energy Transition\u201d beginning on page 14. [Page 47] \u2022 Stockholders consistently commented on the quality of our disclosures, including around Scope 3 emissions. [Page 47] \u2022 Several stockholders commended us on our water disclosures and metrics, and our forward-looking approach to nature-related disclosures. [Page 47] Executive Compensation \u2022 The majority of stockholders either had no questions or concerns about our compensation or indicated support of programs and recent changes. [Page 47] \u2022 The overwhelming majority of stockholders expressed support for how we have tied ESG goals into our short-term incentive program. [Page 47] \u2022 Stockholders supported the increase in our CEO\u2019s stock ownership guidelines from six to eight times salary and did not request additional changes. [Page 47] For the 2023 Proxy Statement, we received a stockholder proposal asking stockholders to vote in favor of requiring NEOs to retain a significant percentage of shares acquired from equity compensation plans until reaching normal retirement age. [Page 47] After evaluating the proposal, the HRCC determined that increasing the CEO\u2019s stock ownership guidelines from six to eight times salary achieved the appropriate balance of being consistent with market practices, enabling us to attract and retain executive talent, and having robust ownership guidelines that align executive compensation with stockholder interests. [Page 47] The proposal failed to receive significant support in 2023 with less than 23% of stockholders indicating support for the proposal as submitted. [Page 47] During engagements in 2023, stockholders were supportive of the change made by the HRCC and did not request any additional changes. [Page 47] Human Capital Management \u2022 Stockholders were interested in hearing more detail related to CEO succession planning. [Page 47] See \u201cManaging Succession Planning Risks\u201d on page 44. [Page 47] \u2022 Stockholders remain interested in hearing about the results of our Perspectives survey and our approach to DEI. [Page 47] See \u201cA Compelling Culture\u201d on page 50. [Page 47] \u2022 Stockholders wanted to learn more about our ability to attract and retain a qualified workforce, including how we measure and analyze employee engagement. [Page 47] See \u201cValuing our People\u201d on page 52. [Page 47] Governance \u2022 Stockholders had questions about our board refreshment and gender diversity, but expressed appreciation for our disclosures and our focus on finding the right candidates for our board. [Page 47] See \u201cBoard Composition and Refreshment\u201d on page 33. [Page 47] \u2022 Stockholders were interested in learning about our leadership structure, and appreciated hearing about how our board has the flexibility and responsibility to review the governance structure on a regular and ongoing basis. [Page 47] See \u201cBoard Leadership Structure\u201d beginning on page 36. [Page 47] For the 2023 Proxy Statement, we received a stockholder proposal asking stockholders to vote in favor of requiring the Board of Directors to amend the governing documents, as necessary, to separate the role of CEO and Chairman. [Page 47] After evaluating the proposal, the Committee on Directors\u2019 Affairs determined that it is in the best interest of ConocoPhillips and its stockholders to maintain flexibility in our governing documents to allow the Board of Directors to determine what organizational model best serves the interest of our company and its stockholders. [Page 47] The proposal failed to receive significant support in 2023, with only approximately 25% of stockholders indicating support for the proposal as submitted. [Page 47] During engagements in 2023, stockholders were interested in learning about our leadership structure, and appreciated hearing about how our board has the responsibility to review the governance structure on a regular and ongoing basis, allowing for adaptability. [Page 47] Stockholders expressed support for the Board of Directors continuing to evaluate whether the combined role of Chairman and CEO is in the best interest of the Company. [Page 47] 47 2024 Proxy Statement Corporate Governance at ConocoPhillips [Page 48] Code of Business Ethics and Conduct ConocoPhillips has adopted a worldwide Code of Business Ethics and Conduct, which applies to all directors, officers, and employees. [Page 48] The Code of Business Ethics and Conduct is designed to help resolve ethical issues in an increasingly complex global business environment and covers topics such as conflicts of interest, insider trading, competition and fair dealing, discrimination and harassment, confidentiality, payments to government personnel, anti-boycott laws, U.S. [Page 48] embargoes and sanctions, compliance procedures, employee complaint procedures, expectations for supervisors, internal investigations, use of social media, and money laundering. [Page 48] In accordance with good corporate governance practices, we periodically review and revise the Code of Business Ethics and Conduct as necessary. [Page 48] The Code of Business Ethics and Conduct is posted on our website under \u201cInvestors > Corporate Governance.\u201d Any amendments to the Code of Business Ethics and Conduct or waivers of it for our directors and executive officers will be posted on our website promptly to the extent required by law. [Page 48] Stockholders may request printed copies of our Code of Business Ethics and Conduct by following the instructions located under \u201cAvailable Information and Q&A About the Annual Meeting and Voting\u201d beginning on page 130. [Page 48] Commitment to Our Culture We believe our performance is not merely about what we do, but how we do it. [Page 48] The way we do our work is what sets us apart and drives our performance. [Page 48] We run our business under a set of guiding principles we call our SPIRIT Values \u2014 Safety, People, Integrity, Responsibility, Innovation, and Teamwork. [Page 48] See \u201cHuman Capital Management\u201d on page 49. [Page 48] We know that our people are one of our greatest assets. [Page 48] Our reputation and integrity require that each employee, officer, director, and those working on our behalf maintain personal responsibility for ethical business conduct. [Page 48] We respect one another and have created an inclusive environment that reflects the different backgrounds, experiences, ideas, and perspectives of our employees. [Page 48] We recognize that a strong corporate culture is critical to our long-term success. [Page 48] Senior management is influential in defining and shaping our corporate culture and sets the expectations and tone for an ethical work environment. [Page 48] Our Board also provides valuable oversight in assessing and monitoring our corporate culture. [Page 48] ConocoPhillips has a long-standing commitment to ensuring respectful, fair, and nondiscriminatory treatment for all employees and maintaining a workforce that is free from all forms of unlawful conduct.

[Page 49] The diverse people of ConocoPhillips have always been the heart of our company, and we recognize that attracting, retaining, and developing talent is a competitive imperative within our changing industry. [Page 49] Governance VALUES AND PRINCIPLES Our ELT and our Board play key roles in setting our HCM strategy and driving accountability for meaningful progress. [Page 49] The ELT and Board engage often on workforce-related topics, including DEI, succession planning, and employee feedback. [Page 49] Our HCM programs are supported by business leaders across ConocoPhillips and overseen and administered by our human resources function. [Page 49] Our human capital management (\u201cHCM\u201d) strategy is built upon the strong foundation of our SPIRIT Values and is responsive to feedback from key stakeholders. [Page 49] Our SPIRIT Values \u2014 Safety, People, Integrity, Responsibility, Innovation, and Teamwork \u2014 set us apart, align our workforce and provide a foundation for our culture. [Page 49] These values set the tone for how we interact with all our stakeholders, internally and externally, and are a source of pride. [Page 49] Our day-to-day work is also guided by the principles of accountability and performance, which means the way we do our work is as important as the results we deliver. [Page 49] Key Elements of our HCM Strategy We depend on our workforce to successfully execute our company\u2019s strategy, and we recognize the importance of creating a workplace where our people feel valued. [Page 49] Our HCM programs are built around three pillars that we believe are necessary for success: a compelling culture, attracting a world-class workforce, and valuing our people. [Page 49] Each of these pillars is described in more detail below and is subject to oversight by our HRCC of the Board of Directors. [Page 49] A COMPELLING CULTURE ATTRACTING A WORLD- CLASS WORKFORCE VALUING OUR PEOPLE \u2022 SPIRIT Values guide our actions \u2022 Annual Perspectives employee engagement survey used to establish meaningful cultural action plans tied to employee feedback \u2022 A dedicated DEI organization aligns strategic actions with DEI pillars: people, programs and process, culture, and our external brand and reputation \u2022 Data analytics leveraged to track key workforce\/engagement metrics through transparent internal dashboards and expanded external disclosures \u2022 Internal and external best practices leveraged to support\/ offer different ways of working through hybrid work programs \u2022 Implemented several office improvement and integration projects to enhance employees\u2019 workplace experience \u2022 Consistent recruitment\/selection practices implemented to minimize bias \u2022 Actively partner with trade associations and minority nonprofit organizations to broaden pipelines of talent \u2022 U.S. [Page 49] Summer Internship Program offers university students a compelling, hands-on experience \u2022 Foster significant long-standing partnerships with universities to build external pipelines of early-career talent; increasing partnerships with Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Hispanic-serving institutions \u2022 A strategic process for allocating university contributions budget to invest in strengthening and expanding our future talent pools, which includes giving to programs that advance DEI \u2022 Robust succession planning process, inclusive of diverse pipelines, implemented to ready employees for future roles and to promote business continuity \u2022 Hands-on Talent Management Teams (\u201cTMTs\u201d) guide employee development \u2022 Real-time recognition programs provide employees with monetary and non- monetary awards \u2022 Reward employees for contributing to our success through: \u2022 Competitive, performance-based compensation packages; global equitable pay practices \u2022 Compensation programs linking individual and company performance \u2022 Inclusive global benefits informed by external market practices and employee needs\/feedback \u2022 Global wellness programs addressing physical\/mental well-being \u2022 Expanded benefits to support families [Page 50] 50 ConocoPhillips Corporate Governance at ConocoPhillips A Compelling Culture How we do our work is what sets us apart and drives our performance. [Page 50] We are experts in what we do and continuously find ways to do our jobs better. [Page 50] Our different backgrounds, ideas and views drive our success. [Page 50] Together, we deliver strong performance, but not at all costs. [Page 50] We embrace our core cultural attributes that are found across the organization. [Page 50] Spotlight Story: Lower 48 Program Ensures Mental Wellness Support Is Just a Colleague Away Mental health matters. [Page 50] To ensure employees have access to resources designed to support their mental health needs, the Lower 48 business unit launched the Mental Health Allyship Program in 2023. [Page 50] As part of this program, 22 employee volunteers serve as Mental Health Allies (\u201cAllies\u201d) to serve as a first point of contact, directing colleagues to internal resources, like the company\u2019s Employee Assistance Program or outside resources in their area. [Page 50] Supported by the company\u2019s mental health experts, Allies have received training to recognize when someone may be struggling or experiencing a decline in their mental well-being. [Page 50] While not professional counselors, Allies help \u201cget the conversation started.\u201d Programs like this help us continue to build an inclusive and diverse work environment that embraces our SPIRIT Values. [Page 50] ADVANCING OUR DEI JOURNEY As our industry evolves, we\u2019ll continue to face both new opportunities and challenges. [Page 50] So, we\u2019ll need the best and brightest people who bring passion and excitement for solving important problems. [Page 50] We also need to cultivate an environment where everyone is encouraged and able to contribute \u2014 no matter their role, level or location. [Page 50] This is how innovation thrives, leading to better business outcomes. [Page 50] That is why we\u2019ve put an emphasis on \u2014 and are committed to \u2014 elevating DEI and creating a great place to work. [Page 50] At ConocoPhillips, we believe our unique differences power the future of energy. [Page 50] Our DEI vision is to foster an inclusive culture that values the rich mixture of backgrounds, identities, and workstyles of our people, built on equitable practices that support all employees in unlocking their full potential. [Page 50] Our commitment to DEI is foundational to our SPIRIT Values and to achieving our business objectives. [Page 50] All employees play a part in creating and sustaining an inclusive work environment because everyone benefits from DEI. [Page 50] The ELT has ultimate accountability for advancing our DEI commitments through a governance structure that includes a Chief Diversity Officer (CDO), a dedicated DEI organization, and a global DEI Council consisting of senior leaders from across the company. [Page 50] The company sets goals and measures progress based on a transparent DEI strategy with four pillars that guide our focus and approach: people, programs and processes, culture, and our external brand and reputation. [Page 50] All company leaders are accountable for advancing DEI through local efforts. [Page 50] Our DEI efforts and progress are regularly reviewed with the Board. [Page 50] Our 2023 focus was on building clarity and connection. [Page 50] Over the course of the year, the CDO and DEI organization sought to align leaders and employees across the company to the refreshed DEI strategy. [Page 50] Highlights from our 2023 DEI accomplishments include: \u2022 Launching our refreshed DEI strategy; \u2022 Reviewing the results of the 2023 Perspectives survey and continuing to integrate the insights into our DEI efforts; \u2022 Updating governance and membership for both global and business unit and functional DEI Councils; \u2022 Enhancing our Employee Networks by clarifying their strategic intent and creating a consistent sponsorship structure; \u2022 Hosting workshops tailored to business units to further educate on the definitions of DEI; and \u2022 Developing a training called DEI Foundations and launching it to senior leadership. [Page 51] 51 2024 Proxy Statement Corporate Governance at ConocoPhillips MEASURING OUR PROGRESS We actively monitor diversity metrics on a global basis. [Page 51] We are committed to being transparent as we build a more diverse and inclusive workplace. [Page 51] Starting in 2019, we published our first DEI Dashboards internally, which contained key DEI statistics for our global and U.S. [Page 51] employees. [Page 51] In keeping with our annual process, we continue to update the dashboards with global and U.S. [Page 51] workforce metrics and industry benchmark data to help compare our internal metrics against the external market and our peers. [Page 51] Making the data visible is an important step in our DEI journey, but what we do with this information is what matters. [Page 51] Our CDO and DEI Council, in conjunction with the ELT, review these metrics and identify appropriate plans and priorities to address trends. [Page 51] We also continue to educate and inform our workforce on underlying trends to raise awareness. [Page 51] Externally, we publish our workforce metrics and HCM disclosures in our Consolidated EEO-1 Reports, Sustainability Report and Human Capital Management Report. [Page 51] We know that for DEI to be sustainable, we need programs and processes that are disciplined, and promote fair, consistent, and equitable treatment of all employees. [Page 51] By ensuring equity in our people-related programs and processes, we can help advance DEI within the company. [Page 51] Some of our focus areas include: \u2022 Performance management: Assigning all employees a \u201chow\u201d rating as part of our performance management process to hold our workforce and our leaders accountable for behaviors, including those that advance DEI. [Page 51] \u2022 Recognition: Awarding a prestigious SPIRIT of Performance Award for DEI advocates. [Page 51] \u2022 Employee Networks: Sponsoring broad participation in our extensive Employee Networks and aligning their work to our DEI pillars. [Page 51] Spotlight Story: LIFT off! [Page 51] In March 2023, more than 130 petrotechnical employees from around the world gathered in Houston for a special learning event, Learning and Innovation for Today and Tomorrow or \u201cLIFT.\u201d LIFT originated in 2019 and is a technical training event for global petrotechnical professionals designed to promote employee engagement, foster innovation, reinforce leadership skills, and drive cross-discipline collaboration and networking. [Page 51] LIFT participants came from a variety of backgrounds and business units, ranging from Geoscience to HSE, and Lower 48 to Qatar. [Page 51] Early and mid-career employees were nominated to participate in the program to build knowledge and expand their networks. [Page 51] Participants left with new problem-solving techniques and enhanced communications skills to help convey complex, technical ideas. [Page 51] Importantly, participants formed connections with peers across the globe. [Page 51] Attracting a World-Class Workforce Our success depends on having the right workforce to meet our business needs. [Page 51] Attracting a skilled, engaged, and diverse workforce is a top priority. [Page 51] We have taken significant actions to embed equity and inclusion into our recruiting practices, from adapting the way we construct job descriptions to striving for our recruiting pipelines to reflect the diversity of the communities in which we operate. [Page 51] To attract top talent for full-time positions and internships, we recruit from a number of universities in the U.S. [Page 51] By attending conferences and recruiting at Hispanic-serving institutions and HBCUs, we continue broadening our pipeline of talent. [Page 51] We closely monitor recruitment metrics through our university and experienced hire dashboards in areas such as gender, ethnicity, and acceptance rates to observe the diversity composition of the candidate pool from application to offer. [Page 51] In addition, voluntary attrition metrics are routinely tracked and disclosed to guide our retention activities, as necessary. [Page 51] We believe our Employee Networks, our emphasis on talent development, and our commitment to DEI, create an environment that promotes retention of our workforce. [Page 52] 52 ConocoPhillips Corporate Governance at ConocoPhillips Valuing our People EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT Developing our world-class workforce is a critical focus for ConocoPhillips. [Page 52] We want employees to feel valued and to add value. [Page 52] Our workforce is developed through a combination of on-the-job learning, formal training, and regular feedback and mentoring. [Page 52] Skill-based TMTs guide employee development and career progression by skills and location. [Page 52] The TMTs help identify our future business needs and assess the availability of critical skill sets within ConocoPhillips. [Page 52] Annually, business leadership and TMTs meet to review succession benches, calibrate talent, and provide recommendations to executive leadership and the Board on future leadership roles that will promote business continuity. [Page 52] We use a performance management program focused on objectivity, credibility, and transparency. [Page 52] The program includes broad stakeholder feedback, real-time recognition, and a formal rating to assess behaviors to ensure they are in line with our SPIRIT Values. [Page 52] Supervisors have access to a voluntary 360-feedback tool to receive feedback on their strengths and opportunities relative to these competencies. [Page 52] We also offer training on a broad range of technical and professional skills, from data analytics to communication skills. [Page 52] Taking steps to measure and assess employee satisfaction and engagement is at the heart of long-term business success and creating a great place to work for our global workforce. [Page 52] Since 2019, the ConocoPhillips Perspectives Survey has been our primary listening platform for gathering feedback on employee sentiment and strengthening our \u201cWho We Are\u201d culture. [Page 52] Leaders analyze the survey data and comments and then identify focus areas for action at both the enterprise and local level. [Page 52] In 2023, our Perspectives survey touched on key themes related to employee satisfaction, company strategy, leadership, career development, DEI, and well-being. [Page 52] We transparently share our survey results internally with global employees, and we also disclose key metrics externally in our HCM report. [Page 52] We look for incremental progress on key drivers of employee satisfaction over time and leverage global and industry benchmark data to help provide transparency on our internal metrics against our peers. [Page 52] COMPENSATION, BENEFITS, AND HEALTH AND WELL-BEING The HRCC oversees many of our employee compensation programs. [Page 52] Our compensation programs are competitive with local markets and are comprised of a base pay rate, the annual Variable Cash Incentive Program (\u201cVCIP\u201d) and, for eligible employees, the Restricted Stock Unit (\u201cRSU\u201d) program. [Page 52] From the CEO to the frontline worker, every employee participates in VCIP, which aligns employee compensation with ConocoPhillips\u2019 success on critical performance metrics and also recognizes individual performance. [Page 52] Our RSU program is designed to attract and retain employees, reward performance, and align employee interest with stockholders by encouraging stock ownership. [Page 52] Our retirement and savings plans are intended to support employees\u2019 financial futures and are competitive within local markets. [Page 52] Our benefits program provides coverage for families requiring disability support, elder care, and child care, including onsite child care, where access locally is a challenge. [Page 52] External Recognition \u2022 Forbes\u2019 World's Best Employers 2023 \u2022 Fortune\u2019s 2023 World\u2019s Most Admired Companies \u2022 Newsweek\u2019s America\u2019s Greatest Workplaces 2023 Public Policy Engagement Legislators and regulators govern all aspects of our industry and have considerable influence on our success. [Page 52] Accordingly, senior leadership and our Board encourage involvement in governmental activities that advance ConocoPhillips\u2019 goals. [Page 52] As a company, we engage in activities that include lobbying government officials, contributing to candidates and political organizations from our corporate treasury and our employee political action committee, and participating in trade associations in order to champion policy solutions that are in the best interests of the company.",

[Page 53] The Board\u2019s Public Policy and Sustainability Committee also has oversight of these plans and processes. [Page 53] In addition, all of these activities are carefully managed by our Government Affairs division in an effort to yield the best business result for ConocoPhillips and to satisfy the various reporting requirements. [Page 53] To learn more about our public policy engagement and view our disclosures related to candidates, political organizations, and trade associations, please visit www.conocophillips.com under \u201cSustainability > Integrating Sustainability > Sustainable Development Governance > Policies and Positions.\u201d Communications with the Board of Directors Stockholders and interested parties may write or call our Board by contacting our Corporate Secretary as provided below: Write to: Call: Email: Annual Meeting Website: ConocoPhillips Board of Directors c\/o Corporate Secretary ConocoPhillips P.O. [Page 53] Box 4783 Houston, TX 77210-4783 (281) 293-3030 boardcommunication@ conocophillips.com www.conocophillips.com\/ annualmeeting Relevant communications will be distributed to the full Board or to individual directors, as appropriate. [Page 53] The Corporate Secretary will not forward business solicitations or advertisements, junk mail and mass mailings, new product suggestions, product complaints, product inquiries, r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, and other forms of job inquiries, surveys, or communications that are unduly hostile, threatening, illegal, or similarly unsuitable. [Page 53] Any communication that is filtered out is available to any director upon request. [Page 53] Director Compensation Our non-employee director compensation program consists primarily of an equity component and a cash component, which is detailed below. [Page 53] Objectives and Principles The Board\u2019s goal in designing non-employee director compensation is to provide a competitive program that will enable us to attract and retain highly skilled individuals with relevant experience to oversee ConocoPhillips\u2019 strategic direction. [Page 53] Our compensation program also reflects the time and talent required to serve on the board of a complex, multinational corporation. [Page 53] The Board seeks to provide sufficient flexibility in the form of compensation to meet directors\u2019 varying needs while ensuring that a substantial portion of compensation is linked to the long-term success of ConocoPhillips. [Page 53] The Board approves levels of compensation after a recommendation from the Committee on Directors\u2019 Affairs, which conducts an annual review with an independent compensation consultant. [Page 53] In 2023, the Committee on Directors\u2019 Affairs met with an independent compensation consultant to review the non-employee director compensation program and to determine whether to recommend any changes to that program. [Page 53] The review included comparisons of director compensation levels with the compensation reference group. [Page 53] See \u201cProcess for Determining Executive Compensation \u2014 Setting Target Compensation \u2014 Compensation Reference Group\u201d beginning on page 79. [Page 53] The consultant noted that our director compensation program was within the limits set out in the stockholder-approved 2023 Omnibus Stock and Performance Incentive Plan under which director awards are made. [Page 53] Effective July 1, 2023, the Board approved, on the basis of benchmarking data, the following compensation changes: \u2022 Increase the cash compensation for the Lead Director from $45,000 to $50,000 \u2022 Increase the cash compensation for the Chair of the Committee on Directors\u2019 Affairs from $15,000 to $20,000 [Page 54] 54 ConocoPhillips Corporate Governance at ConocoPhillips Equity Compensation Non-employee directors receive an annual grant of restricted stock units with an aggregate value of $220,000 on the date of grant. [Page 54] The restricted stock units are fully vested at grant and are credited with dividend equivalents in the form of additional restricted stock units, but they cannot be sold or otherwise transferred. [Page 54] In the case of any newly elected directors, the initial annual equity grant is prorated for the year of election from and including the month of election. [Page 54] Prior to each annual grant, a director may elect the schedule on which the transfer restrictions will lapse. [Page 54] When restrictions lapse, a director will receive unrestricted shares of ConocoPhillips stock in exchange for his or her restricted stock units. [Page 54] Regardless of the schedule a director elects, all restrictions on a director\u2019s restricted stock units will lapse in the event of the director\u2019s retirement, disability, or death, or upon a change in control of ConocoPhillips, unless the director has elected to defer receipt of the shares until a later date. [Page 54] Directors forfeit restricted stock units if, before restrictions lapse (and prior to any change in control), the Board finds sufficient cause for forfeiture. [Page 54] Cash Compensation The non-employee director compensation program, as approved by the Board, consists of the following cash compensation: \u2022 Non-employee director annual cash compensation \u2014 $115,000 \u2022 Lead Director \u2014 $50,000(1) \u2022 Chair of the Audit and Finance Committee \u2014 $35,000 \u2022 Chair of the Human Resources and Compensation Committee \u2014 $27,500 \u2022 Chair of the Public Policy and Sustainability Committee \u2014 $27,500 \u2022 Chair of the Committee on Directors\u2019 Affairs \u2014 $20,000(1) \u2022 All other Audit and Finance Committee members \u2014 $10,000 \u2022 All other Human Resources and Compensation Committee members \u2014 $7,500 \u2022 All other Public Policy and Sustainability Committee members \u2014 $7,500 \u2022 All other Committee on Directors\u2019 Affairs members \u2014 $5,000 This cash compensation is payable in monthly installments. [Page 54] Each director may elect, on an annual basis, to receive all or part of the cash compensation in unrestricted stock or restricted stock units or to have the amount credited to a deferred compensation account. [Page 54] Any such unrestricted stock or restricted stock units will be issued on the last business day of each month and valued using the average of the high and the low market prices of ConocoPhillips common stock on such date. [Page 54] The restricted stock units issued in lieu of cash compensation are subject to the same restrictions as the annual restricted stock units described under \u201cEquity Compensation\u201d above. [Page 54] (1) For the period January 2023 to June 2023, the additional cash compensation for the Lead Director and Chair of Committee on Directors\u2019 Affairs was $45,000 and $15,000, respectively. [Page 54] Deferral of Compensation Non-employee directors can elect to defer their cash compensation into the Deferred Compensation Plan for Non- Employee Directors of ConocoPhillips (\u201cDirector Deferral Plan\u201d). [Page 54] Deferred amounts are deemed to be invested in various mutual funds and similar investment choices, including ConocoPhillips common stock, as selected by the director from a prescribed list. [Page 54] Matching Gift Program Active non-employee directors are eligible to participate in the ConocoPhillips Matching Gift Program. [Page 54] This program provides a dollar-for-dollar match of a donation of cash or securities (up to a maximum of $10,000 annually per donor) to tax-exempt charities and educational institutions, excluding religious, political, fraternal, or athletic organizations. [Page 54] The Board believes the Matching Gift Program is consistent with ConocoPhillips\u2019 commitment to social responsibility. [Page 55] 55 2024 Proxy Statement Corporate Governance at ConocoPhillips Other Compensation We provide transportation or reimburse the cost of transportation when a non-employee director travels on ConocoPhillips business, including to attend meetings of the Board or a committee. [Page 55] From time to time, spouses and other guests of directors may be invited to attend certain meetings at the request of the Board. [Page 55] The Board believes this creates a collegial environment that enhances the effectiveness of the Board. [Page 55] If spouses or other guests are invited to attend meetings, ConocoPhillips reimburses directors for the out-of-pocket cost of the additional travel and related incidental expenses. [Page 55] Any such reimbursement is treated by the Internal Revenue Service as taxable income to the applicable director. [Page 55] Non-employee directors do not receive gross-ups to compensate for the resulting income taxes except in connection with the presentation of a retirement gift. [Page 55] Stock Ownership Each non-employee director is expected to own ConocoPhillips stock in the amount of the aggregate annual equity grants received during his or her first five years on the Board. [Page 55] Directors are expected to reach this level of target ownership within five years after joining the Board. [Page 55] Actual shares of stock, restricted stock, or restricted stock units, including deferred stock units, may be counted in satisfying the stock ownership guidelines. [Page 55] The holdings of each of our directors currently meet or exceed these guidelines.

[Page 55] Walker 132,500 220,050 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 352,550 (1) Ryan Lance and Timothy Leach serve as directors and also as employees of ConocoPhillips. [Page 55] They are not included in this table because all of the compensation they receive from the company is for services they provide as employees; they do not receive any additional compensation for their services as directors. [Page 55] The compensation Mr. [Page 55] Lance received as an employee is summarized starting on page 98. [Page 55] Mr. [Page 55] Leach is not an executive officer, and the compensation he received as an employee in 2023 is summarized below. [Page 55] \u2022 Salary: $723,348(a) \u2022 Bonus: $1,500,000(b) \u2022 Stock Awards: $2,201,851(c) \u2022 Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation: $780,492(d) \u2022 Change in Pension Value and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings: $0 \u2022 All Other Compensation: $377,660(e) \u2022 Total: $5,583,351 [Page 56] 56 ConocoPhillips Corporate Governance at ConocoPhillips (a) Includes any amounts that were voluntarily deferred under the Key Employee Deferred Compensation Plan. [Page 56] (b) Includes the first installment of the payment due under the non-compete, non-solicitation, and confidentiality agreement as outlined in Exhibit 10.1 to our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ending June 30, 2022. [Page 56] If Mr. [Page 56] Leach breaches this agreement, he is required to repay any amounts previously paid to him under the agreement. [Page 56] (c) Amount represents the aggregate grant date fair value of awards made under the Performance Share Program (\u201cPSP\u201d) and the Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program (\u201cERSUP\u201d), as determined in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. [Page 56] See the \u201cEmployee Benefit Plans\u201d section of Note 16 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in ConocoPhillips\u2019 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the relevant assumptions used in this determination. [Page 56] For the awards granted for PSP 23 and for 2023 restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d) under the ERSUP, the grant date fair value was $112.50, but as noted in the Equity Grant Practices outlined on page 95 awards are granted using the average of the closing prices on the 10 trading days preceding the date of grant ($112.658). [Page 56] The difference between these values can increase or decrease the reported amounts from year to year even if target compensation does not change. [Page 56] For 2023, Mr. [Page 56] Leach received a grant of 6,835 RSUs under the ERSUP with a value of $768,938. [Page 56] Mr. [Page 56] Leach received a target grant of 12,737 performance stock units for PSP 23 for the January 2023 \u2013 December 2025 performance period with a value of $1,432,913. [Page 56] The PSP grant is valued at target because it is most probable at the setting of the target for the applicable performance periods that targets will be achieved. [Page 56] If payout was made at maximum levels for company performance the number of performance stock units and value would double from the target, although the value of the actual payout would be dependent upon the stock price and accrued dividend equivalent units at the time of the payout. [Page 56] If payout was made at minimum levels, the number of performance stock units and value would be reduced to zero. [Page 56] (d) The amount shown includes amounts paid under the Variable Cash Incentive Program (\u201cVCIP\u201d). [Page 56] (e) Includes $107,926 related to pre-approved personal travel on company aircraft, based on the approximate aggregate incremental cost to ConocoPhillips for such personal use, including travel for any family member or personal guest. [Page 56] Approximate aggregate incremental cost has been determined by calculating the variable costs for each aircraft during the year, dividing that amount by the total number of miles flown by that aircraft, and multiplying the result by the miles flown for personal use during the year. [Page 56] However, where there were identifiable costs related to a particular trip \u2014 such as fuel, airport landing fees or food and lodging for aircraft personnel who remained at the location of the personal trip \u2014 those amounts are separately determined and included. [Page 56] The amounts shown include incremental costs associated with flights to the hangar or other locations without passengers (commonly referred to as \u201cdeadhead\u201d flights) arising from the non-business use of the aircraft. [Page 56] Mr. [Page 56] Leach has entered into an aviation lease agreement with the company under which reimbursement, subject to FAA limitations, is provided for certain flights which are personal in nature. [Page 56] Amounts included reflect aggregate incremental cost net of reimbursements. [Page 56] Lease reimbursements are allocated to the flight to which they relate but may be paid in a different year due to lease administration. [Page 56] Also includes $4,349 for the aggregate incremental cost of premiums paid by ConocoPhillips for executive group life insurance (coverage equal to two times annual salary) versus the cost of basic life insurance provided to non-executive employees (coverage equal to annual salary). [Page 56] Also includes $59,400 of company contributions under the company\u2019s tax qualified savings plan. [Page 56] Under the terms of its tax-qualified defined contribution plan, ConocoPhillips makes matching contributions and nonelective allocations to the accounts of its eligible employees, including Mr. [Page 56] Leach. [Page 56] Mr. [Page 56] Leach is fully vested in his benefits under the company\u2019s tax-qualified defined contribution plan. [Page 56] Also includes $126,641 of company contributions to non-qualified defined contribution plans. [Page 56] Under the terms of its nonqualified defined contribution plans, ConocoPhillips makes contributions to the accounts of its eligible employees, including Mr. [Page 56] Leach. [Page 56] His contributions under the nonqualified defined contribution plans include matching and company retirement (in lieu of pension) contributions that cannot be made to the company\u2019s tax qualified defined contribution plan due to limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. [Page 56] Mr. [Page 56] Leach is fully vested in his benefit under the company\u2019s nonqualified defined contribution plans. [Page 56] The company\u2019s defined contribution nonqualified deferred compensation plans allow hypothetical investment of deferred amounts in a broad range of mutual funds or other market-based investments, including ConocoPhillips stock. [Page 56] As market-based investments, none of these provide above-market return. [Page 56] Also includes $4,730 of other perquisites and personal benefits including the cost of presentations made to employees and their spouses at company meetings or events, reimbursements for the cost of spousal and other guests attendance at such meetings or events, and the aggregate incremental cost of any other personal benefits or perquisites not integrally and directly related to the performance of the executive\u2019s duties arising from such presentations, meetings, or events, primarily food, drink and transportation. [Page 56] Also includes $60,780 in security costs, primarily related to protection services provided under our Comprehensive Security Program if a risk assessment indicated that enhanced procedures were warranted. [Page 56] Amounts also include $13,834 for tax gross up payments by ConocoPhillips relating to certain taxes incurred by the employee. [Page 56] These taxes arise primarily when ConocoPhillips requests family members or other guests to accompany the employee to a function, and, as a result, the employee is deemed to make a personal use of company assets (for example, when a spouse accompanies an employee on a company aircraft). [Page 56] ConocoPhillips believes such expenses are appropriately characterized as a business expense, and, if the employee has imputed income in accordance with the applicable tax laws, ConocoPhillips will generally reimburse any increased tax costs.",

[Page 57] Outstanding equity awards made to Mr. [Page 57] Leach include long-term incentive awards payable under the PSP and long-term time-vested awards under the ERSUP. [Page 57] Awards continue to have restrictions upon transferability. [Page 57] The market value of these awards as of December 31, 2023 (see footnotes i and ii below) is based on a market value of $116.07 per share (the closing stock price of the company\u2019s common stock on December 29, 2023). [Page 57] The number of shares or units shown is rounded to the nearest whole share, but the related value is based on the actual number of shares (including fractional shares), with aggregate value rounded to the nearest dollar. [Page 57] (i) Includes 19,624 RSUs related to the grant in 2022 under the ERSUP and 6,815 RSUs related to the grant in 2023 under the ERSUP. [Page 57] These awards have a market value as of December 31, 2023, of $3,068,804. [Page 57] Under the ERSUP, stock awards are made in the form of RSUs. [Page 57] The terms and conditions of those units require restriction on transferability, which lapse three years from the anniversary of the grant date. [Page 57] Forfeiture is expected to occur at separation from service if the separation is not the result of death, disability, layoff, or retirement after the executive has reached the age of 55 with five years of service, or after a change in control, although the HRCC has the authority to waive forfeiture. [Page 57] Upon lapse of restrictions, settlement is made in stock. [Page 57] RSUs have no voting rights. [Page 57] Dividend equivalents, if any, on RSUs held are reinvested in additional RSUs. [Page 57] Dividend equivalents are paid at the same time and the same rate as dividends on common stock are paid, not at a preferential rate. [Page 57] (ii) Includes 37,849 target performance unit awards under the PSP for the ongoing performance period beginning January 2022 and 13,189 target performance unit awards under the PSP for the ongoing performance period beginning January 2023. [Page 57] Based on target performance, these awards have a market value as of December 31, 2023, of $5,924,055. [Page 57] There is no assurance that these awards will be granted at, below, or above target after the end of the relevant performance periods because determination of whether to make an actual grant to, and the amount of any actual grant for Mr. [Page 57] Leach is within the discretion of the HRCC. [Page 57] Mr. [Page 57] Leach\u2019s awards under the PSP are made in the form of performance stock units that are subject to restrictions on transferability that lapse three years after the grant date. [Page 57] Forfeiture is expected to occur if the separation is not the result of death, disability, layoff, or retirement after the executive has reached the age of 55 with five years of service, or after a change in control, although the HRCC has the authority to waive forfeiture. [Page 57] The awards will be settled in cash and have no voting rights. [Page 57] The awards accrue dividend equivalents that, during the performance period, are reinvested in additional performance stock units. [Page 57] Dividends or dividend equivalents are not paid at preferential rates, and dividend equivalents are paid at the same time as dividends on common stock. [Page 57] In 2023, Mr. [Page 57] Leach had 70,918 shares acquired on award vesting and delivery at a realized value of $8,521,585. [Page 57] This value includes restricted stock units for the ERSUP award in 2023 for which restrictions were lapsed in order to satisfy required tax withholding. [Page 57] Also includes restricted stock units for an inducement award granted in 2021 for which the second half vested on the second anniversary of the grant date. [Page 57] (2) The non-employee director compensation program, as approved by the Board, consists of the following cash compensation: \u2022 Non-employee director annual cash compensation\u2014$115,000 \u2022 Lead Director\u2014$50,000(a) \u2022 Chair of the Audit and Finance Committee\u2014$35,000 \u2022 Chair of the Human Resources and Compensation Committee\u2014$27,500 \u2022 Chair of Public Policy and Sustainability Committee\u2014$27,500 \u2022 Chair of Committee on Directors\u2019 Affairs\u2014$20,000(a) \u2022 All other Audit and Finance Committee members\u2014$10,000 \u2022 All other Human Resources and Compensation Committee members\u2014$7,500 \u2022 All other Public Policy and Sustainability Committee members\u2014$7,500 \u2022 All other Committee on Directors\u2019 Affairs members\u2014$5,000 (a) For the period January 2023 to June 2023 the additional cash compensation for the Lead Director and Chair of Committee on Directors\u2019 Affairs was $45,000 and $15,000 respectively. [Page 57] Amounts shown include prorated amounts attributable to time served on the board and committee assignments, which may occur during the year. [Page 57] Amounts shown in the Fees Earned or Paid in Cash column include any amounts that were voluntarily deferred to the Director Deferral Plan, received in ConocoPhillips common stock, or received in restricted stock units. [Page 57] Mr. [Page 57] Mullins received 100 percent of his cash compensation in restricted stock units in 2023, and Mr. [Page 57] Niblock received 50 percent of his cash compensation in restricted stock units in 2023, with an aggregate grant date fair value as shown in the table. [Page 57] All other directors received their cash compensation in cash or deferred such amounts into the Director Deferral Plan. [Page 57] (3) Amounts represent the aggregate grant date fair value of stock awards granted under our non-employee director compensation program. [Page 57] For active non-employee directors, on January 15, 2023, each received a 2023 annual grant of restricted stock units with an aggregate value of $220,000 based on the average of the high and low price for our common stock, as reported on the NYSE, on the grant date. [Page 57] These grants are made in whole shares, with fractional share amounts rounded up, resulting in a grant of shares with a value of $220,050 to each non-employee director who was a director on January 15, 2023.

[Page 59] These occurred when a retirement presentation was made to Ms. [Page 59] Devine upon her retirement from the Board. [Page 59] ConocoPhillips has a practice of making gift presentations to its retiring directors, especially those of long service. [Page 59] The fair value of the retirement presentation was imputed to Ms. [Page 59] Devine\u2019s income. [Page 59] In such circumstances, if a director is imputed income in accordance with applicable tax laws, ConocoPhillips generally will reimburse the director for the resulting increased tax costs. [Page 59] All such tax reimbursements have been included above, regardless of whether the corresponding perquisite or personal benefit is required to be reported pursuant to SEC rules and regulations. [Page 59] (b) The amount shown is the fair value of the retirement presentation and cost for Ms. [Page 59] Devine. [Page 59] ConocoPhillips has a practice of making gift presentations to its retiring directors, especially those of long service. [Page 59] (c) The amounts shown are imputed amounts when, following a board meeting, the director was returned to a location other than their point of origin or their tax home and therefore considered to be a personal accommodation or when, in route to or from a board meeting, a personal accommodation was made to make more efficient use of a director\u2019s time and travel requirements. [Page 59] (d) ConocoPhillips maintains a Matching Gift Program under which we match certain gifts by directors to charities and educational institutions, excluding religious, political, fraternal, or athletic organizations, that are tax-exempt under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of the United States or meet similar requirements under the applicable law of other countries. [Page 59] For active directors, the program matches up to $10,000 in each program year. [Page 59] Administration of the program can cause us to pay more than $10,000 in a single fiscal year due to a lag in processing claims. [Page 59] The amounts shown are for the actual payments by ConocoPhillips in 2023. [Page 59] As indicated above, Mr. [Page 59] Lance and Mr. [Page 59] Leach are eligible for the Matching Gift Program as employees rather than as directors. [Page 59] (6) Ms. [Page 59] Devine retired from the Board effective May 16, 2023. [Page 59] The amounts in the table above include her prorated compensation reflecting the portion of 2023 that she served as a director. [Page 59] (7) Ms. [Page 59] Freeman resigned from the Board effective August 3, 2023. [Page 59] The amounts in the table above include her prorated compensation reflecting the portion of 2023 that she served as a director. [Page 60] 60 ConocoPhillips Audit and Finance Committee Report The Audit and Finance Committee (the \u201cAudit Committee\u201d) assists the Board in fulfilling its responsibility to provide independent, objective oversight for ConocoPhillips\u2019 financial reporting functions and internal control systems. [Page 60] The Audit Committee currently consists of six non-employee directors. [Page 60] The Board has determined that each member of the Audit Committee satisfies the requirements of the NYSE as to independence and financial literacy. [Page 60] The Board has determined that at least one member, Arjun N. [Page 60] Murti, is an audit committee financial expert as defined by the SEC. [Page 60] The responsibilities of the Audit Committee are set forth in the written charter adopted by the Board and last amended on October 4, 2019. [Page 60] The charter is available on our website at www.conocophillips.com under \u201cInvestors > Corporate Governance.\u201d THE AUDIT COMMITTEE\u2019S RESPONSIBILITIES INCLUDE: \u2022 Discussing with management, the independent auditors, and the internal auditor the integrity of ConocoPhillips\u2019 accounting policies, internal controls, financial statements, financial reporting practices, and select financial matters, including capital structure, complex financial transactions, financial risk management, retirement plans, and tax planning; \u2022 Reviewing, and coordinating the review by other committees of, significant corporate risk exposures and steps management has taken to monitor, control, and report such exposures; \u2022 Reviewing the qualifications, independence, and performance of our independent auditors and the qualifications and performance of our internal auditors and chief compliance officer; \u2022 Reviewing ConocoPhillips\u2019 overall direction and compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and internal policies, including our Code of Business Ethics and Conduct; \u2022 Assisting the Board in fulfilling its oversight of enterprise risk management, particularly with respect to: (1) market-based risks; (2) financial reporting; (3) effectiveness of information systems and cybersecurity; and (4) commercial trading; \u2022 Discussing with management and the Chief Compliance Officer the implementation and effectiveness of our global compliance and ethics program; and \u2022 Maintaining open and direct lines of communication with the Board and management, our Compliance and Ethics Office, the internal auditors, and the independent auditors. [Page 60] Management is responsible for preparing ConocoPhillips\u2019 financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and for developing, maintaining, and evaluating our internal controls over financial reporting and other control systems. [Page 60] The independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for auditing the annual financial statements prepared by management, assessing the internal control over financial reporting, and expressing an opinion with respect to each. [Page 60] One of the Audit Committee\u2019s primary responsibilities is to assist the Board in its oversight of the integrity of ConocoPhillips\u2019 financial statements. [Page 60] The following report summarizes certain of the Audit Committee\u2019s activities in this regard for 2023. [Page 60] Review with Management. [Page 60] The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed with management the audited consolidated financial statements included in ConocoPhillips\u2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which included a discussion of the quality \u2014 not just the acceptability \u2014 of the accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant judgments, and the clarity of the disclosures. [Page 60] The Audit Committee also discussed management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, included in the financial statements. [Page 61] 61 2024 Proxy Statement Audit and Finance Committee Report Discussions with Internal Audit. [Page 61] The Audit Committee reviewed ConocoPhillips\u2019 internal audit plan and discussed the results of internal audit activity throughout the year. [Page 61] ConocoPhillips\u2019 General Auditor met with the Audit Committee at every in-person meeting in 2023 and was available to meet without management present at each of these meetings. [Page 61] Discussions with the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm. [Page 61] The Audit Committee met throughout the year with Ernst & Young LLP (\u201cEY\u201d), ConocoPhillips\u2019 independent registered public accounting firm, including meeting with EY at each in-person meeting; EY was also available to meet without management present at each of these meetings. [Page 61] The Audit Committee has discussed with EY the matters required to be discussed by standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or PCAOB. [Page 61] The Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from EY required by PCAOB rules and has discussed with EY its independence from ConocoPhillips. [Page 61] In addition, the Audit Committee considered the non-audit services EY provides to ConocoPhillips and concluded that EY\u2019s independence has been maintained. [Page 61] Recommendation to the ConocoPhillips Board of Directors. [Page 61] Based on its review and discussions noted above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in ConocoPhillips\u2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

[Page 61] Walker [Page 62] Item 2: Proposal to Ratify the Appointment of Ernst & Young LLP What am I Voting On? [Page 62] The Audit Committee has appointed EY to serve as ConocoPhillips\u2019 independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2024. [Page 62] You are voting on a proposal to ratify such appointment. [Page 62] What are the Audit Committee\u2019s responsibilities with respect to the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm? [Page 62] The Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention, and oversight of the independent registered public accounting firm retained to audit our financial statements and has the authority to determine whether to retain or terminate the independent auditor. [Page 62] The Audit Committee reviews the experience and qualifications of the senior members of the independent auditor\u2019s team and is directly involved in the appointment of the lead audit partner. [Page 62] Neither the lead audit partner nor the reviewing audit partner performs audit services for ConocoPhillips for more than five consecutive fiscal years. [Page 62] The Audit Committee is also responsible for determining and approving the audit engagement fees and other compensation associated with retaining the independent auditor. [Page 62] The Audit Committee has evaluated the qualifications, independence, and performance of EY and believes that continuing to retain EY to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm is in the best interest of ConocoPhillips\u2019 stockholders. [Page 62] What services does the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm provide? [Page 62] Audit services of EY for fiscal year 2023 included an audit of our consolidated financial statements, an audit of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, and services related to periodic filings made with the SEC. [Page 62] Additionally, EY provided certain other services as described below. [Page 62] 62 ConocoPhillips",

[Page 63] EY\u2019s fees for professional services totaled $13.7 million for 2023 and $13.7 million for 2022. [Page 63] EY\u2019s fees for professional services included the following: \u2022 Audit Fees \u2014 fees for audit services, which related to the fiscal year consolidated audit, the audit of the effectiveness of internal controls, quarterly reviews, registration statements, comfort letters, statutory and regulatory audits, and related accounting consultations, were $12.7 million for 2023 and $12.1 million for 2022. [Page 63] \u2022 Audit-Related Fees \u2014 fees for audit-related services, which consisted of audits in connection with benefit plan audits, other subsidiary audits, special reports, asset dispositions, and related accounting consultations, were $0.9 million for 2023 and $1.5 million for 2022. [Page 63] \u2022 Tax Fees \u2014 fees for tax services, which consisted of tax compliance services and tax planning and advisory services, were $0.1 million for 2023 and $0.1 million for 2022. [Page 63] \u2022 All Other Fees \u2014 fees for other services were negligible in 2023 and 2022. [Page 63] The Audit Committee has considered whether the non-audit services provided to ConocoPhillips by EY impaired EY\u2019s independence and concluded they did not. [Page 63] Who reviews these services and fees? [Page 63] The Audit Committee has adopted a pre-approval policy that provides guidelines for the audit, audit-related, tax, and other non-audit services that EY may provide to ConocoPhillips. [Page 63] The policy (1) identifies the guiding principles that must be considered by the Audit Committee in approving services to ensure that EY\u2019s independence is not impaired; (2) describes the audit, audit-related, tax, and other services that may be provided and the non-audit services that are prohibited; and (3) sets forth pre-approval requirements for all permitted services. [Page 63] Under the policy, all services to be provided by EY must be pre-approved by the Audit Committee. [Page 63] The Audit Committee has delegated authority to review and approve services to its Chair. [Page 63] Any such approval must be reported to the entire Audit Committee at the next scheduled Audit Committee meeting. [Page 63] Will a representative of Ernst & Young be present at the meeting?

[Page 63] 63 2024 Proxy Statement Item 2: Proposal to Ratify the Appointment of Ernst & Young LLP [Page 64] Item 3: Advisory Approval of Executive Compensation What am I Voting On? [Page 64] Stockholders are being asked to vote on the following advisory resolution: RESOLVED, that the stockholders approve the compensation of ConocoPhillips\u2019 Named Executive Officers as described in the \u201cCompensation Discussion and Analysis\u201d section and in the tabular disclosures regarding Named Executive Officer compensation (together with the accompanying narrative disclosures) in this Proxy Statement. [Page 64] ConocoPhillips is providing stockholders with the opportunity to vote on an advisory resolution, commonly known as \u201cSay on Pay,\u201d considering approval of the compensation of ConocoPhillips\u2019 Named Executive Officers. [Page 64] The Human Resources and Compensation Committee, which is responsible for the compensation of our executive officers, has overseen the development of a compensation program designed to attract, retain, and motivate executives who enable us to achieve our strategic and financial goals. [Page 64] The \u201cCompensation Discussion and Analysis\u201d and the tabular disclosures regarding Named Executive Officer compensation, together with the accompanying narrative disclosures, explain the trends in compensation and application of our compensation philosophies and practices for the years presented. [Page 64] The Board believes that ConocoPhillips\u2019 executive compensation program aligns the interests of our executives with those of our stockholders. [Page 64] Our compensation program is guided by the philosophy that ConocoPhillips\u2019 ability to deliver on our disciplined, returns-focused strategy is driven by superior individual performance. [Page 64] The Board believes we must offer competitive compensation to attract and retain experienced, talented, and motivated employees. [Page 64] In addition, the Board believes employees in leadership roles within the organization are motivated to perform at their highest levels when performance-based pay constitutes a significant portion of their compensation. [Page 64] The Board believes that our philosophy and practices have resulted in executive compensation decisions that are aligned with company and individual performance, are appropriate in value, and have benefited ConocoPhillips and its stockholders. [Page 64] What is the effect of this resolution? [Page 64] Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding upon the Board. [Page 64] However, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee and the Board will take the outcome of the vote into account when considering future executive compensation arrangements. [Page 64] What vote is required to approve this proposal? [Page 64] Approval of this proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal. [Page 64] FOR The Board recommends you vote FOR the advisory approval of the compensation of ConocoPhillips\u2019 Named Executive Officers. [Page 64] 64 ConocoPhillips [Page 65] Role of the Human Resources and Compensation Committee Authority and Responsibilities The HRCC is responsible for providing independent, objective oversight for ConocoPhillips\u2019 executive compensation programs, for developing and overseeing the development of a succession management plan for the CEO and Senior Officers, and for determining the compensation of our Senior Officers. [Page 65] Our internal guidelines define a Senior Officer as an employee who is a senior vice president or higher, any executive who reports directly to the CEO, or any other employee considered an officer under Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. [Page 65] As of December 31, 2023, ConocoPhillips had 18 active Senior Officers. [Page 65] In addition, the HRCC acts as administrator of the compensation programs and certain of the benefit plans for Senior Officers and as an avenue of appeal for current and former Senior Officers disputing compensation or certain benefits. [Page 65] Finally, the HRCC assists the Board in overseeing the integrity of ConocoPhillips\u2019 executive compensation practices and programs described in the \u201cCompensation Discussion and Analysis\u201d beginning on page 66. [Page 65] A complete listing of the authority and responsibilities of the HRCC is set forth in the written charter adopted by the Board and last amended on October 9, 2020, which is available on our website at www.conocophillips.com under \u201cInvestors > Corporate Governance.\u201d Members The HRCC currently consists of six members. [Page 65] All members must meet the independence requirements for \u201cnon- employee\u201d directors under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, for \u201cindependent\u201d directors under the NYSE Listed Company Manual, and for \u201coutside\u201d directors under the Internal Revenue Code. [Page 65] The members of the HRCC and the member to be designated as Chair are reviewed and recommended annually by the Committee on Directors\u2019 Affairs to the full Board. [Page 65] Meetings The HRCC holds regularly scheduled meetings in association with each regular Board meeting and meets by teleconference between such meetings as necessary. [Page 65] In 2023, the HRCC had 7 meetings. [Page 65] The HRCC reserves time at each regularly scheduled meeting to review matters in executive session with no members of management or management representatives present except as specifically requested by the HRCC. [Page 65] Additionally, the HRCC reviews and reports annually on the succession-planning process for the CEO and senior management and meets with the Lead Director at least annually to evaluate the performance of the CEO. [Page 65] More information regarding the HRCC\u2019s activities at such meetings appears in the \u201cCompensation Discussion and Analysis\u201d beginning on page 66. [Page 65] The HRCC is committed to a process of continuous improvement in exercising its responsibilities. [Page 65] To that end, the HRCC: \u2022 Routinely receives training regarding best practices for executive compensation; \u2022 With the assistance of management and consultants, independent compensation consultants, and, when deemed appropriate, independent legal counsel, regularly reviews its responsibilities and governance practices in light of ongoing legal and regulatory changes and trends in corporate governance; \u2022 Annually reviews its charter and proposes any desired changes to the Board; \u2022 Annually conducts an assessment of its performance that evaluates the effectiveness of its actions and seeks ideas to improve its processes and oversight; and \u2022 Regularly reviews and assesses whether our executive compensation programs are having the desired effects without encouraging an inappropriate level of risk. [Page 65] 65 2024 Proxy Statement [Page 66] Compensation Discussion and Analysis This Compensation Discussion and Analysis describes the material elements of the compensation of our Named Executive Officers (\u201cNEOs\u201d) and describes the objectives and principles underlying ConocoPhillips\u2019 executive compensation programs, the compensation decisions we have recently made under those programs, and the factors we considered in making those decisions. [Page 66] In 2023, our NEOs included the following: Ryan M. [Page 66] Lance William L. [Page 66] Bullock, Jr. [Page 66] Kelly B. [Page 66] Rose Nicholas G. [Page 66] Olds Dominic E.

[Page 66] Table of Contents Executive Overview 67 Our executive compensation philosophy is focused on linking pay with performance. [Page 66] It is designed to reflect appropriate governance practices, align with the needs of our business, and maintain a strong link between executive pay and successful execution of our strategy. [Page 66] For an overview of ConocoPhillips and our operations, see page 7 of our Proxy Summary.

[Page 67] The HRCC believes a substantial portion of our executive compensation should be equity-based and focused on rewarding long-term performance and furthermore, that this approach most closely aligns the interests of our top executives with those of our stockholders. [Page 67] The four primary elements of our executive compensation program are designed to provide a target total value for compensation that is competitive with our peers and attracts and retains the talented executives necessary to manage a large and complex company like ConocoPhillips.

[Page 69] In addition, our Lead Director, Robert A. [Page 69] Niblock participated in a stockholder meeting at the request of one of our largest institutional investors. [Page 69] BY THE NUMBERS: STOCKHOLDER ENGAGEMENT IN SPRING AND FALL 2023 We contacted stockholders representing over We held meetings with stockholders representing approximately We held meetings with stockholders representing approximately 50% of shares outstanding 40% of shares outstanding 80% of our institutional investor base 69 2024 Proxy Statement Compensation Discussion and Analysis [Page 70] TRACK RECORD OF CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT RESPONSIVE TO STOCKHOLDER FEEDBACK ConocoPhillips has a track record of continuously seeking to evolve our compensation programs to incorporate stockholder feedback, market best practices, and performance and retention considerations. [Page 70] We strive to clarify and simplify our compensation-related disclosures while providing thorough and meaningful details of our process. [Page 70] Below are highlights of recent changes to our compensation programs: \u2022 Effective for the 2024 short-term incentive program and PSP, the Financial metric will include both a relative and absolute measure for Adjusted ROCE to better align payouts with the stockholder experience; payouts will continue to be determined on a formulaic basis \u2022 Effective for the 2023 short-term incentive program, we eliminated relative Total Shareholder Return (but retained in the long-term program) and increased the weighting of our Financial and Operational measures to further strengthen the link between performance of the company and payouts \u2022 Effective for the 2023 short-term incentive program, we created a separately weighted measure for \u201cEnergy Transition Milestones\u201d which enhances the link between our climate commitments and our executive compensation programs \u2022 Effective in 2023, we increased the CEO\u2019s stock ownership guideline from six to eight times salary \u2022 Effective for the 2022 short-term incentive program, we eliminated positive individual performance adjustments for NEOs \u2022 Effective in 2021, the company eliminated all grandfathered tax gross-up benefits under our Change in Control Severance Plan(1) \u2022 Effective in 2021, the company strengthened our stock ownership guidelines by no longer counting unvested PSP target units toward ownership guidelines while maintaining robust guidelines for NEOs; further, the company does not count unexercised stock options towards ownership guidelines (1) Executives who became plan participants after the spinoff in 2012 were not eligible for any gross-up payment. [Page 70] The change removes eligibility for any gross-up payments for executives who were plan participants prior to the spinoff in 2012 and who were previously grandfathered. [Page 70] 2023 STOCKHOLDER PROPOSAL \u2013 SHARE RETENTION UNTIL RETIREMENT For the 2023 Proxy Statement, the Comptroller of the State of New York submitted a proposal asking stockholders to vote in favor of requiring NEOs to retain a significant percentage of shares acquired from equity compensation plans until reaching normal retirement age. [Page 70] After evaluating the proposal, the HRCC determined that increasing the CEO\u2019s stock ownership guidelines from six to eight times salary achieved the appropriate balance of being consistent with market practices, which enables us to attract and retain executive talent, and having robust ownership guidelines that align executive compensation with stockholder interests. [Page 70] During engagements in 2023, stockholders were supportive of the change made by the HRCC and did not request any additional changes. [Page 70] The proposal failed to receive significant support in 2023 with less than 23% of stockholders indicating support for the proposal as submitted by the Comptroller of the State of New York. [Page 70] 70 ConocoPhillips Compensation Discussion and Analysis [Page 71] Executing on our Returns-Focused Value Proposition Delivers Strong Financial and Operational Performance Throughout 2023, ConocoPhillips demonstrated that we can deliver strong financial and operational performance consistent with our value proposition of superior returns to stockholders through price cycles while executing against our Triple Mandate to reliably and responsibly deliver oil and gas production to meet energy transition pathway demand, deliver competitive returns on and of capital to our stockholders, and achieve our net-zero operational emissions ambitions. [Page 71] \u2022 We delivered full year total and Lower 48 record production of 1,826 thousand barrels and 1,067 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day, respectively, while we continued to enhance our portfolio diversity by opportunistically acquiring the remaining 50% working interest in Surmont, reaching FID on the Willow project in Alaska and further progressing our global LNG strategy. [Page 71] \u2022 We achieved a 17 percent return on capital employed(1) and we delivered competitive returns of capital by distributing $11 billion to stockholders through our three-tier framework, including $5.6 billion in cash through the ordinary dividend and variable return of cash (\u201cVROC\u201d) and $5.4 billion through share repurchases. [Page 71] \u2022 We continued to demonstrate our commitment to our net-zero operational emissions ambition by accelerating our GHG emissions-intensity reduction target through 2030 from 40-50% to 50-60%(2) and we were awarded the Oil & Gas Methane Partnership 2.0 Gold Standard Pathway designation. [Page 71] We continue to be guided by our SPIRIT Values and remain committed to executing our foundational principles \u2014 focusing on peer-leading distributions, maintaining a strong balance sheet, executing disciplined investment, and demonstrating responsible and reliable ESG performance. [Page 71] Supporting these core principles are our strategic cash flow allocation priorities: (1) invest enough capital to sustain production and pay the existing dividend; (2) grow the dividend annually; (3) maintain \u2018A\u2019 credit rating; (4) return greater than 30 percent of cash from operations to stockholders; and (5) make disciplined investments to enhance returns. [Page 71] A summary of the many important accomplishments we achieved in 2023 is shown below: 2023 HIGHLIGHTS \u2014 DELIVERING ACROSS ALL ELEMENTS OF THE TRIPLE MANDATE STRATEGY FINANCIAL OPERATIONS \u2022 Acquired remaining 50% working interest in Surmont \u2022 Progressed LNG strategy through expansion in Qatar, FID at PALNG, and regasification agreements in the Netherlands and offtake agreements in Mexico \u2022 Awarded Gold Standard Pathway designation by OGMP 2.0 \u2022 Accelerated GHG emissions- intensity reduction target through 2030(2) \u2022 Distributed $11B to stockholders; $5.6B in ordinary dividend and VROC and $5.4B in share repurchases \u2022 $11.0B earnings; $9.06 EPS; $10.6B adjusted earnings; $8.77 adjusted EPS(1) \u2022 Generated cash provided by operating activities of $20.0B; $21.3B CFO(3); $10.1B FCF(1); ending cash of $6.9B(4) \u2022 Announced 2024 expected return of capital of $9.0B \u2022 Delivered FY company and Lower 48 record production of 1,826 MBOED and 1,067 MBOED, respectively \u2022 Took FID on the Willow project \u2022 Achieved first production on projects in Norway, China and Canada \u2022 Improved completion pumping efficiencies by 10-15% across the Lower 48 (1) Adjusted earnings, adjusted EPS, return on capital employed (ROCE), and free cash flow (FCF) are non-GAAP measures. [Page 71] Further information related to these measures as well as reconciliations to the nearest GAAP measure are included in Appendix A. [Page 71] (2) Using a 2016 baseline. [Page 71] (3) Cash provided by operating activities was ~$20.0B. [Page 71] Excluding operating working capital change of ~($1.4B), cash from operations (CFO) was over $21.3B. [Page 71] CFO is a non-GAAP measure. [Page 71] Further information related to this measure is included in Appendix A. [Page 71] (4) Ending cash includes cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash totaling $5.9B and short-term investments of $1.0B. [Page 71] Restricted cash was $0.3B. [Page 71] Balance excludes $1.0B in long-term investments. [Page 71] We maintained our ongoing practice of engaging with stockholders throughout 2023 and received consistent feedback that our disciplined, returns-focused strategy is the right one for our business and that our stockholders appreciate our ongoing efforts to increase the transparency and robustness of our disclosures to address the things that they care about most.

[Page 72] 72 ConocoPhillips Compensation Discussion and Analysis [Page 73] 73 2024 Proxy Statement Compensation Discussion and Analysis Philosophy and Principles of Our Executive Compensation Program OUR GOALS Our goals are to attract, retain, and motivate high-quality employees and to maintain high standards of principled leadership so we can responsibly deliver energy to the world and provide sustainable value for our stakeholders, now and in the future. [Page 73] OUR PHILOSOPHY \u2014 PAY FOR PERFORMANCE We believe that: \u2022 Our ability to responsibly deliver energy and provide sustainable value is driven by superior individual performance; \u2022 A company must offer competitive compensation to attract and retain experienced, talented, and motivated employees; \u2022 Employees in leadership roles are motivated to perform at their highest levels when performance-based pay is a significant portion of their compensation; and \u2022 The use of judgment by the HRCC plays an important role in establishing increasingly challenging corporate performance criteria to align executive compensation with company performance. [Page 73] OUR STRATEGIC PRINCIPLES To achieve our goals, we implement our philosophy through the following principles: \u2022 Establish target compensation levels that are competitive with the companies that we compete against for executive talent; \u2022 Create a strong link between executive pay and successful execution of our strategy; \u2022 Encourage prudent risk-taking by our executives; \u2022 Motivate performance using compensation to reward specific individual accomplishments; \u2022 Retain talented individuals; \u2022 Maintain flexibility to better respond to the cyclical energy industry; and \u2022 Integrate all elements of compensation into a comprehensive package that aligns goals, efforts, and results throughout the organization. [Page 74] 74 ConocoPhillips Compensation Discussion and Analysis Majority of Executive Compensation is Performance Based Our executive compensation programs align pay with performance that advances our strategic priorities and interests of stockholders. [Page 74] As shown below, approximately 91 percent of the CEO\u2019s 2023 target pay and approximately 81 percent of the other NEOs\u2019 2023 target pay was performance based. [Page 74] Stock-based, long-term incentives make up the largest portion of performance-based pay. [Page 74] VCIP Performance Shares Target Value Executive Restricted Stock Units Salary Annual Incentive Long-term Incentives 2023 TARGET COMPENSATION FOR CEO Salary 9% Stock-Based 77% Performance based 91% Restricted Stock Units 27% Performance Shares 50% VCIP 14% 2023 AVERAGE TARGET COMPENSATION FOR OTHER NEOs Salary 19% Stock-Based 63% Performance based 81% Restricted Stock Units 21% Performance Shares 42% VCIP 18% Components of Executive Compensation The four primary elements of our executive compensation program are designed to provide a target total value for compensation that is competitive with our peers and attracts and retains the talented executives necessary to manage a large and complex organization such as ConocoPhillips. [Page 74] Base Salary Base salary is a central component of compensation for all of our salaried employees. [Page 74] Management, with the assistance of Mercer, its outside compensation consultant, thoroughly examines the scope and complexity of executive jobs throughout ConocoPhillips and benchmarks the competitive compensation practices for such jobs. [Page 74] As a result of this work, management has developed a compensation structure that assigns all positions to specific salary grades. [Page 74] For our executives, the base salary midpoint increases as the salary grade increases, but at a lesser rate than the overall target incentive compensation percentages increase. [Page 74] The result is a higher percentage of at-risk compensation as an executive\u2019s salary grade rises. [Page 74] We set base salaries to be competitive within our compensation reference group and, for certain staff positions, Fortune 50-150 Industrials, taking into account responsibilities and duties, individual performance, and time in position. [Page 74] See \u201cProcess for Determining Executive Compensation \u2014 Setting Target Compensation \u2014 Compensation Reference Group\u201d beginning on page 79 for a discussion of our benchmarking exercise.",

        "chunk_text":"[Page 75] 75 2024 Proxy Statement Compensation Discussion and Analysis Performance-Based Pay Programs ANNUAL INCENTIVE All of our employees throughout the world \u2014 including our executives \u2014 participate in our annual short-term incentive program, called the Variable Cash Incentive Program (\u201cVCIP\u201d). [Page 75] It is our primary vehicle for recognizing company and individual performance for the prior year. [Page 75] We believe that having an annual \u201cat risk\u201d compensation element gives employees a financial stake in the achievement of our business objectives and motivates them to achieve those objectives. [Page 75] For all employees, the base VCIP award is comprised of corporate performance categories including HSE, Operational, Financial, Strategic Milestones, and Energy Transition Milestones. [Page 75] The HRCC has discretion to adjust base awards up or down depending on individual performance, but the final award, inclusive of any adjustments, may not exceed 200 percent of the target. [Page 75] Beginning with the 2022 program, the HRCC eliminated individual performance adjustments in the short-term incentive program for NEOs. [Page 75] LONG-TERM INCENTIVES Our primary long-term incentive compensation programs for executives are the Performance Share Program (\u201cPSP\u201d) and the Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program, which replaced the Stock Option Program effective with equity grants made in 2018. [Page 75] The HRCC approved replacing stock options with three-year, time-vested restricted stock units under the Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program in response to stockholder feedback and to be consistent with market trends. [Page 75] In addition, the HRCC increased the weighting of the long-term incentive award in the form of performance-based restricted stock units under the PSP from 60 percent to 65 percent and assigned a weight of 35 percent to the Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program. [Page 75] Approximately 60 of our current employees participate in these programs. [Page 75] PERFORMANCE SHARE PROGRAM The PSP rewards executives based on ConocoPhillips\u2019 performance over a three-year period. [Page 75] Each year, the HRCC establishes performance metrics for a new three-year performance period. [Page 75] Thus, performance results in any given year are considered in three overlapping performance periods. [Page 75] We believe the use of a multi-year performance period helps to focus management on longer-term results. [Page 75] PSP award targets are set in shares at the beginning of the performance period, and actual cash payouts, based on the HRCC\u2019s evaluation of performance, are calculated using our stock value after the conclusion of the three-year performance period. [Page 75] Thus, the value of the performance shares is tied to stock price performance throughout the performance period. [Page 75] Targets for participants whose salary grades are changed during a performance period are prorated to align incentive levels with the individual\u2019s changing level of responsibility. [Page 75] Changes in salary not accompanied by a change in salary grade do not affect the targets. [Page 75] The targets for the CEO are set annually by the HRCC. [Page 75] The award is calculated on a formulaic basis using a relative TSR metric and a relative Financial metric, with respective weightings of 60 and 40 percent. [Page 75] At the end of the performance period, the final award may not exceed 200 percent of the total target award (the initial target award set in restricted stock units, at the beginning of the performance period, together with any promotional awards and reinvested dividend equivalents during the performance period). [Page 75] The final award is determined by the HRCC following several detailed reviews of company performance and is based on the HRCC\u2019s evaluation of ConocoPhillips\u2019 formulaic performance relative to the preestablished metrics (discussed under \u201cProcess for Determining Executive Compensation \u2014 Corporate Performance Criteria\u201d on page 81). [Page 76] 76 ConocoPhillips Compensation Discussion and Analysis Performance metrics and peers for performance share programs The performance metrics and peers established by the HRCC for the PSP 21 (2021-2023), PSP 22 (2022-2024), PSP 23 (2023-2025), and PSP 24 (2024-2026) awards granted in 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 respectively, have been established as follows: Metrics Performance Peers(1) PSP 21, PSP 22, & PSP 23 \u2022 Relative Total Shareholder Return (60%) \u2022 Relative Adjusted ROCE (40%) PSP 24 \u2022 Relative Total Shareholder Return (60%) \u2022 Relative & Absolute Adjusted ROCE (40%) \u2022 S&P 500 Total Return Index(2) \u2022 APA Corporation \u2022 Chevron Corporation \u2022 Devon Energy Corporation \u2022 Diamondback Energy(3) \u2022 EOG Resources, Inc.

[Page 76] (2) For relative TSR metric only. [Page 76] (3) Performance peer for PSP 24 award only. [Page 76] Diamondback Energy was added to the performance peer group to reflect our significant footprint in the Permian Basin and due to the anticipated completion of the acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources by Exxon Mobil Corporation in 2024. [Page 76] (4) On October 23, 2023, Chevron Corporation announced a planned acquisition of Hess Corporation. [Page 76] Effective upon the completion of the acquisition only the combined company (Chevron Corporation) will be retained for any ongoing performance programs. [Page 76] (5) Performance peer for PSP 21 and PSP 22 awards only. [Page 76] (6) Performance peer for PSP 23 and PSP 24 awards only. [Page 76] Pioneer Natural Resources was added to the performance peer group to better reflect our significant footprint in the Permian Basin. [Page 76] On October 11, 2023, Exxon Mobil announced a planned acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources. [Page 76] Effective upon the completion of the acquisition only the combined company (Exxon Mobil) will be retained for any ongoing performance programs. [Page 76] EXECUTIVE RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT PROGRAM Like the PSP, the Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program is designed to reward our executives for long-term share performance and encourage executive retention while incentivizing absolute performance that is aligned with stockholder interests. [Page 76] The restricted stock units vest three years following the date of grant, which is competitive with industry peers. [Page 76] The combination of the PSP and the Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program, along with our Stock Ownership Guidelines described under \u201cExecutive Compensation Governance \u2014 Alignment of Interests \u2014 Stock Ownership and Holding Requirements\u201d on page 95, provides a comprehensive package of long-term incentives for our executives that align their interests with stockholders. [Page 76] STOCK OPTION PROGRAM In response to stockholder feedback and consistent with market trends, the HRCC discontinued the Stock Option Program effective with equity grants made in 2018 and substituted the Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program. [Page 76] The practice under the Stock Option Program was to set option exercise prices no lower than the fair market value of ConocoPhillips stock at the time of the grant. [Page 76] Because an option\u2019s value is derived solely from an increase in our stock price, options only reward recipients if the value of our stock appreciates. [Page 76] All previously granted and unexercised stock options are vested and exercisable and expire 10 years following the grant date. [Page 76] OFF-CYCLE AWARDS ConocoPhillips may make awards outside the PSP or the Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program. [Page 76] Currently, off-cycle awards are generally granted to certain incoming executives for one or more of the following reasons: (1) to induce an executive to join ConocoPhillips (occasionally replacing compensation the executive will lose by leaving the prior employer); (2) to induce an executive of an acquired company to remain with ConocoPhillips for a certain period of time following the acquisition; or (3) to provide a pro rata equity award to an executive who joins ConocoPhillips during an ongoing performance period in which the executive is ineligible to participate under the standard PSP or Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program provisions. [Page 76] In these cases, the HRCC has sometimes approved a shorter period for restrictions on transfers of restricted stock units than those issued under the PSP or Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program. [Page 76] Any off-cycle awards to Senior Officers must be approved by the HRCC. [Page 77] 77 2024 Proxy Statement Compensation Discussion and Analysis Process for Determining Executive Compensation Our executive compensation programs take into account market-based compensation for executive talent; internal pay equity among our employees; corporate, business unit, and individual results; and the talents, skills, and experience that each individual executive brings to ConocoPhillips. [Page 77] Our NEOs each serve without an employment agreement. [Page 77] All compensation for these officers is set by the HRCC as described below. [Page 77] ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES HUMAN RESOURCES AND COMPENSATION COMMITTEE (HRCC) \u2022 Annually reviews and determines compensation for the CEO and for each of the NEOs. [Page 77] \u2022 Makes critical decisions on competitive compensation levels, program design, performance targets and associated peer groups, corporate and individual performance, and appropriate pay adjustments necessary to reflect short- and long-term performance. [Page 77] \u2022 Considers annual benchmark data provided by the consultants, dialogues with our largest stockholders, and evaluates four in-depth management reviews of ongoing corporate performance. [Page 77] \u2022 The HRCC also has sole authority to retain, terminate, and obtain advice and assistance from a compensation consultant, external legal, accounting, and other advisors and consultants. [Page 77] The HRCC conducts an annual review of the HRCC\u2019s independent consultant and has discretion to replace the independent consultant. [Page 77] The HRCC approves in advance all the work to be done by the independent consultant. [Page 77] MANAGEMENT \u2022 ConocoPhillips\u2019 Human Resources department supports the HRCC in the execution of its responsibilities and manages the development of the materials for each committee meeting, including market data, individual and company performance metrics, and compensation recommendations. [Page 77] \u2022 The CEO considers performance and makes individual recommendations on base salary, annual incentive, and long-term equity compensation with respect to Senior Officers, including all NEOs other than himself. [Page 77] These recommendations are reviewed, discussed, modified, and approved, as appropriate, by the HRCC. [Page 77] No member of the management team, including the CEO, has a role in determining his or her own compensation. [Page 77] COMPENSATION CONSULTANTS The HRCC retained FW Cook as its independent executive compensation consultant in 2023. [Page 77] Management also retained Mercer to provide other consulting services. [Page 77] The consultants compile compensation data, conduct analyses, supplement internal resources for market analysis, and assist in the evaluation of the compensation of the CEO and Senior Officers. [Page 77] The HRCC considered whether any conflict of interest exists with either FW Cook or Mercer in light of SEC rules. [Page 77] The HRCC assessed the following factors relating to each consultant in its evaluation: \u2022 Other services provided to us by the consultant; \u2022 Fees paid by us as a percentage of the consulting firm\u2019s total revenue; \u2022 Policies or procedures maintained by the consulting firm that are designed to prevent a conflict of interest; \u2022 Any business or personal relationships between the individual consultants involved in the engagement and a member of the HRCC or executive officers; and \u2022 Any ConocoPhillips stock owned by the individual consultants involved in the engagement. [Page 77] Both FW Cook and Mercer provided the HRCC with appropriate assurances addressing such factors. [Page 77] Based on this information, the HRCC concluded the work of the consultants did not raise any conflict of interest. [Page 77] The HRCC also took into consideration all factors relevant to FW Cook\u2019s independence from management, including those specified in Section 303A.05(c) of the NYSE Listed Company Manual, and determined that FW Cook is independent and performs no other services for ConocoPhillips. [Page 77] ConocoPhillips is prohibited from employing any FW Cook consultant who worked on our account for a period of one year after that individual leaves the employment of the independent consultant.

[Page 78] As part of the analysis, we considered the performance measures we use, as well as the different types of compensation, varied performance measurement periods, and extended vesting schedules utilized under each incentive compensation program. [Page 78] As a result of this review, management concluded the risks arising from our compensation policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on ConocoPhillips. [Page 78] As part of the Board\u2019s oversight of ConocoPhillips\u2019 risk management programs, the HRCC conducts a similar review with the assistance of its independent compensation consultant. [Page 78] The HRCC agrees with management\u2019s conclusion that the risks arising from our compensation policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on ConocoPhillips. [Page 78] 78 ConocoPhillips Compensation Discussion and Analysis [Page 79] 79 2024 Proxy Statement Compensation Discussion and Analysis Setting Target Compensation \u2014 Compensation Reference Group COMPENSATION REFERENCE GROUP AND METHODOLOGY The HRCC regularly assesses the market competitiveness of our executive compensation programs based on data from a compensation reference group. [Page 79] The compensation reference group is currently made up of 11 energy industry companies and 11 similarly sized general industry companies that are comparable to ConocoPhillips in terms of size, scope, and compensable factors. [Page 79] The HRCC utilizes a broader reference group that includes non-energy industry companies for compensation benchmarking given that ConocoPhillips is uniquely positioned as one of the largest independent E&P companies based on production and reserves. [Page 79] This reference group, inclusive of general industry companies, provides more statistically robust compensation data from companies with similar compensable factors as E&P industry consolidation occurs and is responsive to stockholder feedback. [Page 79] Accordingly, in analyzing the appropriate composition of the reference group that would help inform 2023 target compensation decisions, the HRCC considered the following criteria: (1) Companies with which we compete for business opportunities and executive talent; (2) Companies with significant operations and capital investments, medium- and long-term project investment cycles, and complex global operations; (3) Size, including revenues, assets, and market capitalization; and (4) Industry focus, particularly companies in the energy industry. [Page 79] The data is used to assess the competitive market value for executive jobs, assess pay practices, validate targets for pay programs, test the compensation strategy, observe trends, and provide a general competitive foundation for decision-making.

[Page 79] This competitive analysis consists of comparing the market data of each of the pay elements and total compensation at the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of the compensation reference group to compensation for each of our NEOs. [Page 79] Target total compensation for each NEO is structured to target market competitive pay levels at approximately the 50th percentile in base salary and short- and long-term incentive opportunities, taking into account roles, responsibilities and duties, experience, individual performance, and time in position. [Page 79] The HRCC's independent consultant, FW Cook, reviews and independently advises on the conclusions reached as a result of this benchmarking.",

It focuses on annual incentives (VCIP) and long-term incentives (PSP and Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program), as well as the processes for determining executive compensation.",
            "main_points":"ConocoPhillips utilizes a Variable Cash Incentive Program (VCIP) for all employees, including executives, based on company performance across HSE, Operational, Financial, Strategic, and Energy Transition Milestones. Long-term incentives include the Performance Share Program (PSP), rewarding executives based on three-year performance using metrics like relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) and relative Adjusted ROCE, and the Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program, which replaced the Stock Option Program. The Human Resources and Compensation Committee (HRCC) plays a crucial role in determining compensation, engaging independent consultants for benchmarking and risk assessment, and ensuring alignment with stockholder interests. The HRCC uses a compensation reference group of energy and general industry companies to assess market competitiveness and target compensation levels around the 50th percentile.",

        "chunk_text":"[Page 80] 80 ConocoPhillips Compensation Discussion and Analysis CEO 2023 Compensation In reviewing 2023 target compensation for the CEO, the HRCC considered the median target compensation of the compensation reference group, which was approximately $18 million with a median tenure of approximately five years. [Page 80] Based on this review and considering Mr. [Page 80] Lance\u2019s tenure (11 years), overall performance, the performance of ConocoPhillips, and the relative positioning of target compensation for Mr. [Page 80] Lance as compared to the market median of the compensation reference group, the HRCC increased Mr. [Page 80] Lance\u2019s 2023 base salary by 3% effective March 1, 2023, his 2023 short-term incentive target from 160% to 165% and his 2023 long-term incentive target awards by $0.8 million. [Page 80] The increase to his long-term incentive target had no pension impact. [Page 80] Internal Pay Equity We believe our compensation structure provides a framework for an equitable compensation ratio among our executives, with higher targets for jobs involving greater duties and responsibilities. [Page 80] Our compensation program is designed so that the individual target level rises as salary grade level increases, with the portion of performance-based compensation rising as a percentage of total target compensation. [Page 80] The HRCC reviews the compensation of Senior Officers periodically to ensure the equitable compensation of officers with similar levels of responsibilities. [Page 80] Developing Performance Measures We believe our performance measures appropriately reflect the performance of ConocoPhillips consistent with our strategy as an independent E&P company. [Page 80] Specifically, the HRCC has approved a balance of metrics, some that measure performance relative to our peer group, some that measure absolute performance, and some that measure progress in executing our strategic and energy transition milestones and objectives. [Page 80] We have selected multiple metrics, as described herein, because we believe no single metric is sufficient to capture the performance we are seeking to drive. [Page 80] Moreover, reliance on any metric in isolation is unlikely to promote the well-rounded executive performance necessary to enable us to achieve long-term success. [Page 80] It is for this reason that metrics are assessed in tandem, rather than each with a separate weighting and threshold. [Page 80] The HRCC reassesses performance metrics periodically to confirm that they remain appropriate. [Page 80] Setting Increasingly Challenging Targets Targets for each metric are set in accordance with our rigorous internal budget. [Page 80] The HRCC believes that increasingly challenging performance metrics best assess ConocoPhillips\u2019 performance relative to its strategy as an independent E&P company. [Page 80] Increasingly challenging targets can mean year-over-year performance target increases for safety, efficiency, emissions reduction, unit cost targets, and margins. [Page 80] However, it can also mean the same or lower performance targets, recognizing a changing commodity price environment. [Page 80] For example, delivering flat production targets following significant capital and operating cost reductions or establishing production targets below those set in prior years after significant asset dispositions would be considered \u201cincreasingly challenging.\u201d Likewise, setting higher cost or capital targets above those set in prior years after significant acquisitions or periods of rising inflation would be considered \u201cincreasingly challenging.\u201d [Page 81] 81 2024 Proxy Statement Compensation Discussion and Analysis Corporate Performance Criteria Individual NEO payouts are determined based on the payout for corporate performance. [Page 81] We use the compensation metrics described below, as approved by our HRCC, to determine the corporate performance payout. [Page 81] The compensation metrics support our Triple Mandate, are consistent with our strategic cash flow allocation priorities, and, therefore, are aligned with our goal to deliver superior returns to stockholders through price cycles. [Page 81] See \u201cExecutive Compensation \u2014 Strategic Alignment\u201d beginning on page 72. [Page 81] The HRCC determines the ultimate payout of our programs based on how well ConocoPhillips performs against targets set for each of these metrics. [Page 81] The compensation metrics and how they align with our strategic priorities and desired outcomes are described in more detail below. [Page 81] VCIP HSE 20% Strategic Milestones 10% Energy Transition Milestones 10% Operational 30% Financial 30% PSP TSR 60% Financial 40% HEALTH, SAFETY, AND ENVIRONMENTAL (VCIP ONLY) Everything we do depends on safely executing our business plans and operating to high standards of HSE stewardship. [Page 81] We view this as our fundamental license to operate. [Page 81] We have a comprehensive HSE program across our entire company, which includes criteria for process and personal safety. [Page 81] We include relative Total Recordable Rate and Process Safety Events in our compensation metrics to reinforce our commitment to be an industry leader in HSE, drive continuous HSE improvement, and provide accountability for HSE at all levels of the organization, including among our senior leaders. [Page 81] Total Recordable Rate is a measure of the rate of recordable injury cases in a year. [Page 81] Process Safety Events is a measure of the control of process hazards in a facility with the potential to impact people, property, or the environment. [Page 81] This includes the prevention, control, and mitigation of unintentional releases of hazardous material or energy from primary containment. [Page 81] We invest significant resources and provide focused attention to continually improve our safety culture and performance across the entire company. [Page 81] OPERATIONAL (VCIP ONLY) As an E&P company, strong operational performance is essential for delivering on our commitments to stockholders. [Page 81] Our Operational metrics include absolute targets for Production, Capital, Operating and Overhead Costs, and Operational Milestones. [Page 81] Our primary source of revenue and cash flow is the sale of our produced oil and gas. [Page 81] Therefore, we set an annual Production target, and we measure results against the approved target. [Page 81] Importantly, we tie our annual Production target to annual targets for Capital, Operating and Overhead Costs, and Operational Milestones. [Page 81] This is designed to ensure that we do not inadvertently incentivize actions, such as growing at all costs, that are misaligned with our strategic priorities. [Page 81] Effective capital and operating cost management also helps us achieve a low cost of supply portfolio in support of our returns-focused strategy. [Page 81] The Operational Milestones and targets are also designed to create alignment within our workforce around delivering business plans while maintaining discipline. [Page 82] 82 ConocoPhillips Compensation Discussion and Analysis FINANCIAL (VCIP AND PSP) The Financial metrics in our compensation programs strongly align with our returns-focused strategy, are core to delivering our value proposition of superior returns through cycles, and strongly correlate to total shareholder returns (\u201cTSR\u201d) and value creation for stockholders. [Page 82] Adjusted ROCE is an important metric for ensuring ConocoPhillips is efficiently allocating capital and is a strong indicator of long-term share price performance. [Page 82] We include Adjusted ROCE in both our VCIP and PSP to ensure that we maintain financial discipline and balance short- and long-term performance. [Page 82] Our Financial compensation measure includes Adjusted ROCE relative to peers over a one- and three-year period. [Page 82] Evaluation of our performance relative to peers is designed to provide above or below target payouts based on our performance against our performance peer group. [Page 82] These relative metrics are measured from third quarter to third quarter for the relevant periods because full-year peer data is not publicly available at the time of the HRCC annual performance assessment. [Page 82] Therefore, Adjusted ROCE as used for our Financial compensation metrics will differ from ROCE as calculated for other periodic reporting. [Page 82] For VCIP and PSP, the impact of non-operational results and special items that are unusual or nonrecurring are removed as well as the impact of cash, consistent with ConocoPhillips\u2019 strategy to maintain cash on the balance sheet to ensure adequate liquidity through down cycles. [Page 82] Adjusted ROCE is calculated as follows: earnings plus or minus special items plus after-tax interest expense plus minority interest \u00f7 cash adjusted average capital employed (total equity plus total debt less cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments) STRATEGIC MILESTONES (VCIP ONLY) Delivering on our value proposition requires that we take actions and steward the business in ways that are not exclusively operational or financial in nature. [Page 82] Our Strategic Milestones represent annual actions to progress our long-term objectives that position the company to grow and develop over the coming years and decades and that are aligned to our strategy. [Page 82] These metrics provide a direct link from our stated strategy to metrics in the compensation programs. [Page 82] ENERGY TRANSITION MILESTONES (VCIP ONLY) Effective with our 2023 short-term incentive program, we created a separately weighted measure for \u201cEnergy Transition Milestones.\u201d These milestones are guided by our Triple Mandate to reliably and responsibly deliver oil and gas production to meet energy transition demand while delivering competitive returns and focusing on achieving our net-zero operational emissions ambition. [Page 82] Creating a separate metric serves to further enhance the link between our climate commitments and our executive compensation programs. [Page 82] RELATIVE TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN (PSP ONLY) We believe our Operational and Financial measures and Strategic and Energy Transition Milestones have a strong, positive correlation to TSR in our sector. [Page 82] Thus, as we pursue these measures, we expect to achieve superior returns to stockholders. [Page 82] TSR is the best overall indicator of our long-term success. [Page 82] By integrating compensation metrics with strategic priorities, we believe we are strongly aligned with stockholder interests across time periods and through cycles. [Page 82] We believe it is important to include TSR in our PSP because it is the most tangible, visible measure of the value we have created for stockholders during the relevant period. [Page 82] TSR represents the percentage change in stock price from the beginning to the end of a performance period, plus the percentage impact from common stock dividends paid during the performance period assuming dividends are reinvested into the stock. [Page 82] Consistent with market practice, we calculate TSR for compensation purposes based on a 20-trading day simple average prior to the beginning of a period and a 20-trading day simple average prior to the end of the stated period. [Page 83] 83 2024 Proxy Statement Compensation Discussion and Analysis We measure TSR relative to our performance peer group to mitigate the influence of sector-wide factors, such as commodity price volatility, on our stock price. [Page 83] MEASURING PERFORMANCE \u2014 PERFORMANCE PEER GROUP Our performance peer group is used to evaluate relative business results in both our annual incentive and performance share programs. [Page 83] This includes both relative TSR and relative Adjusted ROCE. [Page 83] The HRCC believes our performance is best measured against both large independent E&P companies with diverse portfolios and some of the largest publicly held integrated oil and gas companies that we compete against in our business operations. [Page 83] In addition, the S&P 500 Total Return Index is included in our performance peer group (for the relative TSR metric only) because the HRCC believes that we should be measured against the companies that we compete with for capital in the broader market. [Page 83] We believe that our performance peer group is representative of the companies that investors use for relative performance comparisons. [Page 83] Additionally, the inclusion of the index as a performance peer further aligns executive pay with long-term stockholder interests as we will be required to outperform both industry peers and a market-based index to receive a maximum payout. [Page 83] The following tables show the performance peer groups that were established for evaluating relative metrics for the periods indicated.

[Page 84] 2023 Executive Compensation Analysis and Results The following is a discussion and analysis of the decisions the HRCC made regarding our NEOs in 2023. [Page 84] Base Salary The HRCC reviews base salary annually for each of the NEOs. [Page 84] The salary adjustment program is determined by annual benchmarking. [Page 84] Individual salary increases are the result of individual performance, relative position to market, and changes to salary grade. [Page 84] Base salaries for the CEO and for Messrs. [Page 84] Olds and Macklon and Ms. [Page 84] Rose were increased 3 to 8 percent effective March 1, 2023, based on their performance and competitive positioning relative to their peers in the compensation reference group. [Page 84] Effective March 1, 2023, the HRCC approved a promotion, including a 5 percent base salary increase, for Mr. [Page 84] Bullock reflecting the broad scope of his responsibilities, performance, and competitive positioning relative to peers in the compensation reference group. [Page 84] The table below shows the annualized base salary for each NEO as of the date shown: Name 12\/31\/2022 12\/31\/2023 R.M. [Page 84] Lance $1,700,000 $1,751,000 W.L. [Page 84] Bullock, Jr. [Page 84] 964,776 1,013,016 K.B. [Page 84] Rose 924,000 951,984 N.G. [Page 84] Olds 787,536 850,560 D.E. [Page 84] Macklon 858,528 910,056 Performance-Based Programs Actual awards earned under our performance-based programs can range from zero to 200 percent of the initial award for our NEOs. [Page 84] In determining performance-based compensation awards for our NEOs for performance periods concluding at the end of 2023, the HRCC began by assessing overall company performance. [Page 84] To that end, the HRCC considered the performance reviews throughout and after the performance period ended to assess the degree of difficulty in achieving absolute performance targets and the extent to which such targets were achieved. [Page 84] The HRCC then used the percentile-based matrix below to formulaically evaluate the results of the Financial metric (relative Adjusted ROCE) in the VCIP and PSP and the relative TSR metric in the PSP. [Page 84] 0% Below 25th Percentile Rank Payout 25th 50th 85th or higher 35% 100% 200% If between two levels, straight line interpolation is used. [Page 84] 84 ConocoPhillips Compensation Discussion and Analysis [Page 85] Annual Incentive \u2014 Variable Cash Incentive Program (VCIP) All of our employees are eligible for the VCIP. [Page 85] The VCIP payout for our NEOs is calculated using the following formula with the maximum VCIP payout capped at 200 percent of target. [Page 85] The HRCC has the sole authority to determine the corporate performance payout based on its assessment of our performance against our metrics. [Page 85] Beginning with the 2022 VCIP, the HRCC eliminated positive individual performance adjustments for the NEOs, and payouts are solely determined by the corporate performance payout approved by the HRCC. [Page 85] Target Percentage for the Salary Grade Eligible Earnings Corporate Performance Payout VCIP CORPORATE PERFORMANCE We incorporate a balance of metrics into our annual incentive program that align with delivering our value proposition and maintaining competitiveness versus our performance peer group. [Page 85] Our program includes both line-of-sight and strategic metrics, as well as both absolute and relative metrics. [Page 85] We do not believe that a single metric is sufficient for driving the behaviors or performance we seek. [Page 85] Therefore, we carefully consider and select a combination of metrics that best ensures accountability across the organization for both short- and longer-term business success. [Page 85] The HRCC routinely reviews and reassesses the VCIP performance metrics and confirm that they remain appropriate for driving desired performance outcomes. [Page 85] In December 2022, the HRCC approved the five corporate performance measures by which it would judge corporate performance for the 2023 VCIP payout. [Page 85] The corporate measures and assigned weights were: HSE (20%); Operations (30%); Financial (30%); Strategic Milestones (10%); and Energy Transition Milestones (10%). [Page 85] The HRCC determines the ultimate payout of our programs based on the extent to which ConocoPhillips achieves the targets established under the five corporate performance measures set forth above. [Page 85] These measures support our Triple Mandate and directly correspond to our strategic cash flow allocation priorities, which support our goal to deliver superior returns to stockholders through price cycles. [Page 85] See \u201cExecutive Compensation \u2014 Strategic Alignment\u201d on page 72 and \u201cProcess for Determining Executive Compensation \u2014 Corporate Performance Criteria\u201d beginning on page 81.

        "summarization":{
            "introduction":"This text discusses ConocoPhillips' compensation strategy for its executives in 2023, focusing on the CEO's compensation review and the design of performance-based programs. The Human Resources and Compensation Committee (HRCC) plays a key role in setting targets, evaluating performance, and ensuring equitable compensation.",
            "main_points":"The HRCC reviewed the CEO's compensation, considering market data, tenure, and company performance, leading to increases in base salary, short-term incentive target, and long-term incentive target awards. ConocoPhillips aims for internal pay equity through a compensation structure that rewards greater responsibilities with higher targets and a larger portion of performance-based compensation. Performance measures are balanced between peer comparisons, absolute targets, and strategic\/energy transition milestones, assessed collectively rather than individually weighted. The corporate performance payout under the Variable Cash Incentive Program (VCIP) is determined by the HRCC based on metrics including HSE, operational, financial, strategic milestones, and energy transition milestones. The HRCC uses a peer group to evaluate relative performance in annual incentive and performance share programs, assessing metrics like TSR and Adjusted ROCE. Base salaries for NEOs were increased based on performance and competitive positioning, and performance-based programs can result in awards ranging from 0% to 200% of the initial award.",
            "conclusion":"ConocoPhillips' executive compensation is structured to align with the company's strategic priorities, emphasizing both short-term and long-term performance, and is closely monitored by the HRCC to ensure equity and drive desired outcomes. The company uses a mix of metrics and peer comparisons to ensure executive pay is aligned with shareholder interests and the company's overall success."

        "chunk_text":"[Page 86] SETTING TARGETS FOR 2023 The HRCC reviews and approves targets for the performance metrics annually. [Page 86] The process begins with our rigorous internal budget, which is set each year across the organization and then approved by our Board. [Page 86] For setting VCIP targets, the outputs from the internal budget are reviewed for alignment with the value proposition, as well as degree of difficulty. [Page 86] The HRCC believes that targets should reflect a reasonable chance of achievability, but also be challenging. [Page 86] Significant effort is invested to ensure that the metrics and targets reflect both a desire for continuous improvement and a realistic assessment of changes in the market environment and our portfolio. [Page 86] For the relative Financial metric, the HRCC established a matrix to inform payout decisions, see page 84. [Page 86] In the case of HSE, Operations, Strategic Milestones, and Energy Transition Milestones metrics, the HRCC relies on a rigorous and transparent review process with management and exercises its judgment based on its knowledge of the business to assess degree of difficulty and determine the appropriate payout (see \u201cHRCC Review Process\u201d beginning on page 88). [Page 86] The HRCC does not believe either a matrix or a threshold-maximum approach is appropriate for all metrics given the significant volatility of the business in any given year and the influence of non-operated activities over which ConocoPhillips has limited control. [Page 86] Having a threshold-maximum approach could incentivize behaviors that are counter to the best interest of ConocoPhillips and its stockholders. [Page 86] Based on our 2023 outreach, we believe the majority of stockholders were satisfied with the level of disclosure around our process, and we have continued to enhance transparency around our targets and results and have sought to continuously improve our disclosures around payout decisions. [Page 86] Absolute VCIP targets for 2023 were aligned with the production, capital, and operating and overhead external guidance ConocoPhillips provided externally. [Page 86] See \u201cHRCC Annual Compensation Cycle\u201d on page 78. [Page 86] The HSE, Operations, Financial, Strategic Milestones, and Energy Transition Milestones targets set by the HRCC are as follows: HSE We target top-quartile performance relative to our peers for Total Recordable Rate and absolute continuous improvement for TRR and for Process Safety Events. [Page 86] We target being an industry leader in HSE in an effort to drive continuous HSE improvement and provide accountability for HSE at all levels of the organization, including among our senior leaders. [Page 86] OPERATIONS Production The target was set at 1,790 MBOED, which was aligned with the guidance provided to the marketplace in 2023. [Page 86] The HRCC considered the target to be increasingly challenging. [Page 86] On an adjusted basis, the Production target represented 3 percent organic growth as compared to 2022 pro forma production of 1,730 MBOED. [Page 86] The HRCC also considered the target to be increasingly challenging when balanced with the Operating and Overhead Costs target and Capital target. [Page 86] Capital The target was set at $11.2 billion, which was consistent with the operating plan outlined to the marketplace in 2023. [Page 86] The Capital target was an increase of approximately 11 percent from full-year 2022 capital expenditures, due to increased spend on longer-cycle projects, including PALNG, Willow, NFE and NFS, more than offsetting the absence of 2022 acquisition spend. [Page 86] 86 ConocoPhillips Compensation Discussion and Analysis [Page 87] Operating and Overhead Costs The target was set at $8.2 billion, which was consistent with the operating plan outlined to the marketplace in 2023. [Page 87] The Operating and Overhead target was an increase of approximately 6 percent from the full year 2022 operating and overhead expenditures due to volume growth and inflation. [Page 87] Operational Milestones In the Lower 48, milestones included delivering on Big 3 unconventional development programs as well as progressing optimization efforts across the basins. [Page 87] In Canada, milestones included transitioning Montney to early development by achieving flowback on Pad 5 and Pad 6, as well as starting up the second phase of the company\u2019s gas processing facility. [Page 87] Additionally in Canada, milestones for Surmont included achieving first steam on Pad 267. [Page 87] In Alaska, milestones included reaching FID on Willow, subject to regulatory and legal resolutions, and advancing Nuna 3T to AFE approval. [Page 87] In Norway, milestones included mechanically completing the first subsea template and facilities on Tommeliten A. [Page 87] In Malaysia, milestones included advancing WL4-00 toward AFF decision and finalizing a strategic path forward. [Page 87] In China, milestones included achieving Bohai Phase 4B first oil and sanctioning Bohai Windfarm AFE, subject to government approval. [Page 87] The exploration milestones included executing the Bear-1 exploration well in Alaska. [Page 87] Additionally, we included a corporate technology milestone to deliver the first release of nxtgenERP with no loss of business effectiveness or integrity. [Page 87] FINANCIAL Our financial performance is measured according to our relative performance of Adjusted ROCE among our peers. [Page 87] STRATEGIC MILESTONES Our Strategic milestones included: \u2022 Progressing the LNG business through advancing new PALNG, NFE, and NFS projects, securing several regasification and offtake agreements, and building out our LNG organization; \u2022 Implementing action plans for priority E&S risks and tracking progress against mitigations; and \u2022 Refreshing our DEI strategy globally and identifying how to assess progress on each component of diversity, equity, and inclusion. [Page 87] The HRCC believes these targets, which aligned with external guidance provided to the marketplace, were appropriate and challenging and consistent with ConocoPhillips\u2019 disciplined, returns-focused strategy. [Page 87] ENERGY TRANSITION MILESTONES Our Energy Transition Milestones included: \u2022 Demonstrating progress against our Plan for the Net-Zero Energy Transition; \u2022 Achieving an annual GHG emissions intensity aligned with our 2030 target trajectory range(1), including any updates to the 2030 target; \u2022 Executing our capital and cost budget for approved MACC projects; and \u2022 Advancing multiple low carbon opportunities. [Page 87] (1) In 2023, we increased our target trajectory range from 40-50% to 50-60% gross operated emissions intensity reduction, using a 2016 baseline. [Page 87] 87 2024 Proxy Statement Compensation Discussion and Analysis [Page 88] HRCC REVIEW PROCESS After meeting to approve the metrics (as discussed above), the HRCC met four more times with management to review progress and performance against the approved metrics to determine award payouts under the VCIP. [Page 88] The first and second reviews occurred during 2023 and were designed to provide the HRCC with information concerning the ongoing performance of ConocoPhillips. [Page 88] The third review with the HRCC in late January 2024 focused on the detailed final results for each performance metric relative to the targets, a degree of difficulty discussion, and an explanation of normalization adjustments when appropriate. [Page 88] The final review in mid-February 2024 focused on a summary of the results for each performance metric and deliberation and determination of the final payout by the HRCC. [Page 88] This process allows the HRCC to consider results, degree of difficulty, and normalization adjustments in one meeting and make informed payout decisions in a separate meeting. [Page 88] Results for Production, Operating and Overhead Costs, and Capital, as applicable, are normalized to account for acquisitions and dispositions (e.g., dispositions of non-strategic assets in the Lower 48), foreign exchange rates, commodity price-related adjustments of actuals to targets and related tax and production- sharing contract impacts, and items beyond the control of management (e.g., production impacts from natural disasters). [Page 88] This allows the HRCC to measure results against targets on a consistent basis and measure management performance so there is no benefit or detriment to executive compensation for these items. [Page 88] The normalization adjustments are reviewed by and discussed with the HRCC. [Page 88] The HRCC retains the discretion to make a positive or negative adjustment to awards based on its determination of appropriate payouts. [Page 88] Beginning with the 2022 VCIP, the HRCC eliminated positive individual adjustments for the NEOs, and payouts are solely determined by the corporate performance payout approved by the HRCC. [Page 88] 2023 RESULTS HSE (ABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE) \u2013 20% weighting 2023 was a challenging year for HSE. [Page 88] Although we had several successes, there were also opportunities for improvement. [Page 88] We remained in the top quartile among our peers for TRR, and we experienced fewer process safety events as compared to 2022. [Page 88] We also experienced zero spills greater than 100 barrels. [Page 88] Although we remained an industry leader among our peers, we had an increase in serious incidents, including one fatality. [Page 88] This serves as a reminder to keep focusing on surpassing the bar that we continuously raise. [Page 88] The HRCC believes that the resulting 85% payout reflects ConocoPhillips\u2019 overall HSE performance. [Page 88] OPERATIONS (ABSOLUTE) \u2013 30% weighting Our operations performance resulted in adjusted Production of 1,813 MBOED, 1 percent above our target of 1,790 MBOED. [Page 88] Production performance was strong across our portfolio, driven by Lower 48 well performance and accelerated timing. [Page 88] Our Capital spending of $11.1 billion, adjusted for approved scope changes, came in 1 percent below our 2023 VCIP target of $11.2 billion. [Page 88] Our Operating and Overhead Costs came in 4 percent above the $8.2 billion target, reaching $8.6 billion, due to higher non-operated workover activity, higher volumes and commodity\u2013driven inflation. [Page 88] We also achieved or exceeded all of our Operational Milestones (see \u201cOperational Milestones\u201d on page 87) with the exception of the nxtgenERP milestone, where we made the decision to delay releases to complete additional testing to address potential impacts to business effectiveness. [Page 88] In considering the results of these interdependent operations metrics collectively, the degree of difficulty, and the company\u2019s strong execution of operating plans, the HRCC determined a slightly above- target payout (125%) was warranted. [Page 88] 88 ConocoPhillips Compensation Discussion and Analysis [Page 89] FINANCIAL (RELATIVE) \u2013 30% weighting Our Adjusted ROCE relative to peers was in the 58th percentile, which was driven by our operational performance and success across our global portfolio. [Page 89] The HRCC followed the matrix on page 84 to determine the payout (122%). [Page 89] STRATEGIC MILESTONES (ABSOLUTE) \u2013 10% weighting We far exceeded expectations on all of the Strategic Milestones. [Page 89] We significantly progressed the LNG business through advancing new PALNG, NFE and NFS projects, secured regasification and offtake agreements and staffed key roles. [Page 89] We identified and implemented action plans for risk mitigations. [Page 89] We remained focused on DEI, completing the development of educational DEI materials, and leveraging DEI Perspectives survey data to refresh our DEI strategy. [Page 89] In addition, we identified how to assess progress on each component of diversity, equity, and inclusion. [Page 89] The HRCC determined a maximum payout (200%) was warranted given ConocoPhillips\u2019 exceptional performance in achieving the Strategic Milestones. [Page 89] ENERGY TRANSITION MILESTONES (ABSOLUTE) \u2013 10% weighting We successfully demonstrated meaningful progress against our Plan for the Net-Zero Energy Transition, including by increasing our target trajectory range for 2030 from 40-50% to 50-60% of gross operated emissions intensity reduction using a 2016 baseline. [Page 89] We also achieved an annual GHG emissions intensity aligned with our 2030 target trajectory range. [Page 89] In addition, we completed our approved MACC projects within the allotted capital and cost budget. [Page 89] We also advanced multiple low carbon opportunities. [Page 89] The HRCC determined that an above target payout (190%) was appropriate considering our demonstrated commitment to progressing towards our energy transition goals. [Page 89] These results reflect a strong year for ConocoPhillips. [Page 89] We achieved or exceeded our target for almost every metric and showed our commitment and ability to deliver strong financial and operational performance across our global portfolio. [Page 89] The HRCC believes that the resulting 130% corporate performance payout reflects ConocoPhillips\u2019 overall strong performance in 2023. [Page 89] 89 2024 Proxy Statement Compensation Discussion and Analysis [Page 90] The following table describes the details of what the HRCC considered as the quantitative and qualitative performance measures and summarizes the payout decisions: Metric Category Category Weighting Metric VCIP Target VCIP Results and Performance Summary Payout Weighted Payout HSE 20% Total Recordable Rate (\u201cTRR\u201d) (relative) Top-quartile performance and industry leader Continued focus on safety performance, achieving top-quartile TRR; opportunities for improvement remain 85% 17% Process Safety Events (\u201cPSE\u201d) Continuous Improvement Zero spills >100 barrels; fewer process safety events as compared to prior year; increase in serious incidents, including a fatality Operations(1) 30% Production 1,790 Exceeded target by 1% with adjusted production 1,813 MBOED; strong performance driven by L48 125% 37% Capital ($B) $11.2 Delivered capital scope with $11.1B, within 1% of target Operating and Overhead Costs ($B) $8.2 Managed operating and overhead costs to $8.6B, 4% above target Operational Milestones See Operational Milestones discussed on page 87 Achieved or exceeded all operational milestones, except for nxtgenERP, which was delayed to complete additional testing to address potential impacts to business effectiveness Financial(2) 30% Relative Adjusted ROCE Based on our relative performance Finished 4th in peer group (58th percentile) 122% 37% Strategic Milestones 10% LNG Progress LNG business through advancing new PALNG, NFE, and NFS projects, securing several regasification and offtake agreements, and building out LNG organization Achieved all objectives; expanded global LNG business; secured several regasification and offtake agreements; built out LNG organization by staffing key roles to enable integration and development of commercial strategies 200% 20% E&S Risks Implement action plans for priority E&S risks and track progress against mitigations Identified priority E&S risks and successfully tracked progress against mitigations DEI Launch our refreshed Global DEI strategy and identify how to assess progress on each component of diversity, equity, and inclusion Achieved all objectives; refreshed our DEI strategy globally and successfully progressed elements of our DEI priorities Energy Transition Milestones 10% Progress Plan for Net-Zero Energy Transition Demonstrate progress toward our Plan for the Net-Zero Energy Transition Achieved all objectives; advanced opportunities and increased our target trajectory range for 2030 from 40-50% to 50-60%(3) of gross operated emissions intensity reduction 190% 19% Emissions Achieve an annual GHG emissions intensity aligned with our 2030 target trajectory range, including any updates to the 2030 target Achieved, even with the increase in our target trajectory range Abatement Execute approved MACC projects Achieved under the allotted budget Advance LCT Opportunities Advance multiple low carbon opportunities Advanced multiple low carbon opportunities Total Payout 130% 90 ConocoPhillips Compensation Discussion and Analysis [Page 91] (1) Operating and overhead costs include production and operating expenses; selling, general, and administrative expenses; and controllable exploration general and administrative expenses, geological and geophysical, and lease rental and other expenses, adjusted to remove the impact of special items that are unusual or nonrecurring. [Page 91] Operating and Overhead Costs results and the absolute metric results for Capital are adjusted to normalize, as applicable, for acquisitions and dispositions, foreign exchange rates, price, and related tax and production-sharing contract impacts, and items beyond the control of management. [Page 91] Actual operating and overhead costs and capital for 2023 were $8.6B and $11.2B, respectively. [Page 91] (2) For relative metrics, adjustments for material, nonrecurring special items (e.g., gains on dispositions, impairments) are made to company results to determine Adjusted ROCE, and we also use disclosed material adjustments made by peers when measuring relative results for these metrics. [Page 91] Adjusted earnings (loss) that are part of the Adjusted ROCE calculations is a non-GAAP financial measure. [Page 91] A reconciliation to GAAP and a discussion of the usefulness and purpose of adjusted earnings (loss) can be found in Appendix A. [Page 91] (3) Using a 2016 baseline. [Page 91] VCIP Payouts for the NEOs The calculation of the 2023 VCIP award for each NEO is summarized below. [Page 91] The HRCC eliminated individual positive performance adjustments for the NEOs effective with the 2022 VCIP, so the payout below solely reflects the corporate performance payout approved by the HRCC.

[Page 92] Approximately 60 of our current employees participate in the PSP. [Page 92] Grants made to NEOs in 2023 for PSP 23 are summarized in note 3 of the Summary Compensation Table on page 98. [Page 92] Performance measures and peers for all ongoing programs can be found on page 76. [Page 92] PSP 21 PERFORMANCE In 2021, the HRCC approved performance metrics for the PSP performance period running from January 2021 through December 2023. [Page 92] The PSP uses staggered three-year performance periods, with PSP 21 using two corporate performance measures: (1) relative Total Shareholder Return, which is weighted 60%; and (2) relative Financial, which is weighted 40%. [Page 92] The HRCC considered ConocoPhillips\u2019 overall performance based on the PSP 21 performance measures set forth above, which, similar to VCIP, directly correspond to our strategic priorities and support our goal to deliver superior returns to stockholders through price cycles. [Page 92] See \u201cExecutive Overview \u2014 Executive Compensation \u2014 Strategic Alignment\u201d on page 72 and \u201cProcess for Determining Executive Compensation \u2014 Corporate Performance Criteria\u201d beginning on page 81. [Page 92] HRCC REVIEW PROCESS In determining award payouts under PSP 21, the HRCC met several times with management throughout the performance period to review progress and performance against the approved metrics. [Page 92] The review with the HRCC in late January 2024 focused on the detailed final results for each performance metric. [Page 92] The final review in mid-February 2024 focused on a summary of the results for each performance metric and deliberation and determination of the final payout by the HRCC. [Page 92] This process allows the HRCC to consider results in one meeting and make informed payout decisions in a separate meeting. [Page 92] 2021 \u2013 2023 RESULTS TSR \u2013 60% weighting Three-year TSR of 46% resulted in a relative ranking of 4th in TSR, putting us in the 71st percentile (160% payout per the matrix) in TSR compared to our performance peer group based over the three-year performance period on the 20-day average methodology, outperforming the independent and integrated performance peer average and the overall peer average, including significantly outperforming the S&P 500. [Page 92] The HRCC then followed the matrix on page 84 in making its determination of the payout for this relative TSR metric. [Page 92] FINANCIAL \u2013 40% weighting We finished 4th in Adjusted ROCE (63rd percentile) relative to our performance peers over the three-year performance period (137% payout per the matrix). [Page 92] The HRCC followed the matrix on page 84 in making its determination of the payout for the relative Financial metric. [Page 92] The HRCC believes ConocoPhillips is executing the right strategy and recognizes the leadership and commitment our executives demonstrated during the performance period. [Page 92] The HRCC believes that a 151% formulaic payout reflects ConocoPhillips\u2019 overall strong performance during the 2021-2023 performance period. [Page 92] 92 ConocoPhillips Compensation Discussion and Analysis [Page 93] The HRCC believes there is strong alignment between stockholder interests and executive compensation. [Page 93] The following table describes the details the HRCC considered as quantitative performance measures and summarizes the payout decisions for PSP 21: Metric Category Category Weighting Metric PSP Results and Performance Summary Payout Weighted Payout TSR 60% Total Shareholder Return (relative to peers) 4th in peer group (71st percentile; 160% payout per matrix) for 2021- 2023 based on 20-day average methodology 160% 96% Financial(1) 40% Adjusted ROCE (relative to peers) 4th in peer group (63rd percentile; 137% payout per matrix) 137% 55% Total Payout 151% (1) Adjustments for material, nonrecurring special items (e.g., gains on dispositions, impairments) are made to company results to determine Adjusted ROCE, and we also use disclosed material adjustments made by peers when measuring relative to peer performance. [Page 93] Adjusted earnings (loss) in the absolute Adjusted ROCE calculations is a non-GAAP financial measure. [Page 93] A reconciliation to GAAP and a discussion of the usefulness and purpose of adjusted earnings (loss) can be found in Appendix A. [Page 93] Long-Term Incentive: Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program All 2023 awards under the Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program were made at target. [Page 93] Approximately 60 of our current employees participate in this program. [Page 93] The 2023 grants to NEOs can be found in note 3 of the Summary Compensation Table on page 98. [Page 93] Other Executive Compensation and Benefits Other Compensation and Personal Benefits In addition to our four primary compensation components, we provide our NEOs a limited number of benefits as described below. [Page 93] Some benefits, such as executive life insurance coverage and nonqualified benefit plans, are provided for competitive reasons. [Page 93] Other benefits are designed primarily to promote a healthy work\/life balance, to provide opportunities for developing business relationships, and to personalize our social responsibility programs. [Page 93] Comprehensive Security Program \u2014 Because our executives face personal safety risks in their roles as representatives of a global E&P company, our Board has adopted a comprehensive security program for our executives. [Page 93] Personal Entertainment \u2014 ConocoPhillips executives participate in community, university, and philanthropic organizations at the request of the company. [Page 93] We also purchase tickets to various cultural, charitable, civic, entertainment, and sporting events for business development and relationship-building purposes, as well as to maintain our involvement in communities where we operate. [Page 93] Occasionally, our employees, including our executives, make personal use of tickets that would not otherwise be used for business purposes. [Page 93] We believe these tickets offer an opportunity to expand our networks at a very low or no incremental cost to ConocoPhillips. [Page 93] Tax Gross-Ups \u2014 Certain of the personal benefits received by our executives are deemed by the Internal Revenue Service to be taxable income to the individual. [Page 93] When we determine that such income is incurred for purposes more properly characterized as company business than personal benefit, we provide additional payments to the executive to reimburse the cost of including the item in the executive\u2019s taxable income. [Page 93] Most often, these tax gross-up payments are provided for travel by a family member or other personal guest to attend a meeting or function at our request in furtherance of company business, such as Board meetings, company-sponsored events, and industry and association meetings where spouses or other guests are expected to attend. [Page 93] 93 2024 Proxy Statement Compensation Discussion and Analysis [Page 94] Tax and Financial Planning Services \u2014 We provide our NEOs with certain tax, estate, and financial planning services up to $15,000 plus any travel\u2013related expenses incurred by the advisor when meeting with an executive. [Page 94] The benefit is provided while serving as an executive and for up to six months following retirement from the company. [Page 94] We do not provide a tax gross-up for these benefits. [Page 94] Executive Life Insurance \u2014 We provide life insurance policies and death benefits for all of our U.S.-based salaried employees (at no cost to the employee) with a face value approximately equal to the employee\u2019s annual salary. [Page 94] For each of our executives under the ConocoPhillips benefits program, we maintain an additional life insurance policy (at no cost to the executive) with a value approximately equal to the executive\u2019s annual salary. [Page 94] In addition to these two plans, we also provide our executives the option of purchasing group variable universal life insurance or term life insurance in an amount up to eight times their respective annual salaries. [Page 94] We believe that making additional insurance available for purchase at their own expense is valued by our executives and can be provided at no cost to ConocoPhillips. [Page 94] Defined Contribution Plans \u2014 In addition to the ConocoPhillips Savings Plan, which is our qualified defined contribution plan for U.S.-based employees, we maintain the nonqualified defined contribution plans listed below for our executives. [Page 94] These plans allow deferred amounts to grow tax-free until distributed, while enabling ConocoPhillips to use the money for the duration of the deferral period for general corporate purposes. [Page 94] These types of plans are common among our competitors, and we believe the lack of such plans would put ConocoPhillips at a disadvantage in attracting and retaining talented executives. [Page 94] \u2022 Voluntary Deferred Compensation Plans \u2014 The purpose of our voluntary nonqualified deferred compensation plans is to allow executives to defer a portion of their salary and incentive compensation so that such amounts are not immediately taxable. [Page 94] \u2022 Make-Up Plans \u2014 The purpose of our nonqualified defined contribution make-up plans is to provide benefits that an executive would otherwise lose due to limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code on high-income participants in qualified plans. [Page 94] Additional information on these plans is provided under Nonqualified Deferred Compensation beginning on page 107. [Page 94] Defined Benefit Plans \u2014 In addition to the ConocoPhillips Retirement Plan, which is our qualified defined benefit plan for U.S.-based employees, we also maintain nonqualified defined benefit plans for our executives. [Page 94] The primary purpose of these plans is to provide benefits that an executive would otherwise lose due to limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code on high-income participants in qualified plans. [Page 94] The U.S. [Page 94] nonqualified defined benefit plan available to our NEOs is the Key Employee Supplemental Retirement Plan (\u201cKESRP\u201d). [Page 94] This type of plan is common among our competitors and we believe the lack of such a plan would put ConocoPhillips at a disadvantage in attracting and retaining talented executives. [Page 94] Effective January 1, 2019, the ConocoPhillips Retirement Plan was closed to new hires and rehires who will instead receive an enhanced benefit under the ConocoPhillips Savings Plan and a related make-up plan. [Page 94] Additional information on the KESRP is provided under Pension Benefits beginning on page 105. [Page 94] Severance Plans and Changes in Control We maintain plans to address severance of our executives in certain circumstances as described under Executive Severance and Changes in Control beginning on page 109. [Page 94] Plans of this nature are common within the industry. [Page 94] Our plans are designed to aid ConocoPhillips in attracting and retaining executives. [Page 94] Under each of our severance and change in control severance plans, the executive must terminate from service with ConocoPhillips to receive severance pay. [Page 94] Excise tax gross-up benefits are not available under these plans. [Page 94] Vesting of awards under the PSP, Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program, and Stock Option Program that are assumed by an acquirer will accelerate only upon the occurrence of both a change in control event and a qualifying termination of employment of the employee (usually called a \u201cdouble trigger\u201d). [Page 94] Broadly Available Plans Our NEOs are eligible to participate in the same basic benefits package as our other U.S. [Page 94] salaried employees. [Page 94] This includes expatriate benefits; relocation services; medical, dental, vision, life, and accident plans; health savings accounts; and flexible spending arrangements for health care and dependent care expenses. [Page 94] 94 ConocoPhillips Compensation Discussion and Analysis [Page 95] Executive Compensation Governance Alignment of Interests \u2014 Stock Ownership and Holding Requirements We place a premium on aligning the interests of our executives with those of our stockholders. [Page 95] All executives are subject to stock ownership guidelines, with an eight times base salary guideline for the CEO (increased from six times effective in 2023) and three to four times base salary guideline for other NEOs. [Page 95] Executives have five years from the date they become subject to the Stock Ownership Guidelines to comply. [Page 95] Holdings counted toward the guidelines include: (1) shares of stock owned individually, jointly, or in trusts controlled by the employee; (2) restricted stock and restricted stock units; (3) shares owned in qualified savings or stock ownership plans, whether vested or not; and (4) stock or units in nonqualified deferred compensation plans, whether vested or not. [Page 95] Holdings not counted toward the guidelines include PSP target units and unexercised stock options. [Page 95] Employees subject to the guidelines who have not reached the required level of stock ownership are expected to hold shares received upon vesting or earn-out of restricted stock, restricted stock units (net of shares for taxes), and shares received upon exercise of stock options (net of shares tendered or withheld for payment of exercise price and shares for taxes), so they meet their requirement in a timely manner. [Page 95] The multiple of equity held by each of our NEOs currently exceeds our established guidelines. [Page 95] Clawback Policy The HRCC has approved a Clawback Policy providing that ConocoPhillips will recoup any incentive compensation (cash or equity) paid or payable to any executive to the extent such recoupment is required or contemplated by the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), the Sarbanes- Oxley Act, or any other applicable law or listing standards. [Page 95] To comply with NYSE listing standards and final SEC rules under the Dodd-Frank Act, the HRCC adopted a restated Clawback Policy effective October 2, 2023. [Page 95] The Clawback Policy requires the Board to recoup incentive compensation (cash or equity) paid in the event of certain business circumstances, including a financial restatement. [Page 95] The policy operates in addition to provisions already contained in our award documents for the PSP, the Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program, the Stock Option Program, and other compensation programs using company equity. [Page 95] Those documents permit the HRCC or other granting committee to suspend rights to exercise, refuse to honor the exercise of awards already requested, or cancel awards granted if an executive engages in any activity we determine is detrimental to ConocoPhillips, including acts of misconduct (such as embezzlement, fraud, theft, or disclosure of confidential information) or other acts that harm our business, reputation, or employees, as well as misconduct that results in ConocoPhillips having to prepare an accounting restatement. [Page 95] To date, no NEOs have been subject to any clawbacks. [Page 95] Anti-Pledging and Anti-Hedging Pursuant to our insider trading policy, ConocoPhillips directors, officers and all other employees are prohibited from pledging company stock, holding company stock in a margin account, or entering into hedging transactions, including the use of financial instruments such as prepaid variable forwards, equity swaps, collars, and exchange funds. [Page 95] This policy, together with the Stock Ownership Guidelines discussed above, helps ensure that our NEOs and other Senior Officers remain subject to the risks, as well as the rewards, of stock ownership. [Page 95] Equity Grant Practices When the HRCC awards Performance Share Units, Executive Restricted Stock Units, or other equity grants to the NEOs, the fair market value of the units or the exercise price of the options or other equity is determined based on an average of the stock\u2019s high and low prices on the date of grant (or the preceding business day, if the markets are closed on the date of grant). [Page 95] For purposes of granting such awards, we use an average of the closing prices on the 10 trading days preceding the date of grant. [Page 95] Grants of Performance Share Units and Executive Restricted Stock Units are generally made at the HRCC\u2019s February meeting (the date of which is determined at least a year in advance) or, in the case of new hires, on the date of commencement of employment or the date of HRCC approval, whichever is later. [Page 95] 95 2024 Proxy Statement Compensation Discussion and Analysis [Page 96] Statutory and Regulatory Considerations In designing, implementing, and determining compensation under our compensation programs, we act in accordance with our compensation philosophy and believe that attracting, retaining, and motivating our employees with compensation programs that support long-term value creation is in the best interests of our stockholders. [Page 96] However, we also take into account the various tax, accounting, and disclosure rules associated with various forms of compensation. [Page 96] We have reviewed and considered the deductibility of executive compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code and designed deferred compensation programs with the intent that they comply with or are exempt from Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. [Page 96] We generally seek to preserve tax deductions for executive compensation where possible and commensurate with our practice of aligning pay with performance. [Page 96] Nonetheless, ConocoPhillips has awarded compensation that is not fully tax deductible when the HRCC believes that doing so is in the best interest of our stockholders, and ConocoPhillips reserves the right to do so in the future.

Other compensation elements include restricted stock units, personal benefits, life insurance, deferred compensation plans, severance arrangements, and broad-based benefits available to all employees.

[Page 98] (2) Our primary short-term incentive compensation arrangement for employees (the Variable Cash Incentive Program or \u201cVCIP\u201d) has performance measures established by the HRCC and communicated to employees, including the NEOs, at a time when the outcome of the performance is substantially uncertain for the 2023 performance period. [Page 98] The HRCC must determine the level of achievement under such performance measures before there is any payout to NEOs. [Page 98] Because of this process, amounts paid under the VCIP are shown in the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column of the table, rather than the Bonus column. [Page 98] (3) Amounts shown represent the aggregate grant date fair value of awards made during each of the years indicated under the Performance Share Program (\u201cPSP\u201d) and the Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program as determined in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. [Page 98] See the \u201cEmployee Benefit Plans\u201d section of Note 16 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in ConocoPhillips\u2019 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the relevant assumptions used in this determination. [Page 98] For the awards granted for PSP 23 and 2023 Executive RSUs, the grant date fair value was $112.50, but as noted in the Equity Grant Practices outlined on page 95 awards are granted using the average of the closing prices on the 10 trading days preceding the date of grant ($112.658). [Page 98] The difference between these values can increase or decrease the reported amounts from year to year even if target compensation does not change.

[Page 99] Macklon 16,346 1,838,925 8,802 990,225 2,829,150 The amounts shown for awards from the PSP relate to the respective three-year performance periods that began in each of the years presented. [Page 99] Performance periods under the PSP generally are three years. [Page 99] As a new performance period has begun each year since the program commenced, there are three overlapping performance periods ongoing at any time. [Page 99] The amounts shown for 2021 include the full initial target for PSP 21 for the January 2021\u2013December 2023 performance period, as well as any incremental targets set during 2021 with regard to any ongoing performance period as a result of promotions (Mr. [Page 99] Bullock and Mr. [Page 99] Macklon were promoted in 2021). [Page 99] The amounts shown for 2022 include the full initial target for PSP 22 for the January 2022\u2013December 2024 performance period, as well as any incremental targets set during 2022 with regard to any ongoing performance period as a result of promotions (Mr. [Page 99] Olds was promoted in 2022). [Page 99] The amounts shown for 2023 include the full initial target for PSP 23 for the January 2023\u2013December 2025 performance period, as well as any incremental targets set during 2023 with regard to any ongoing performance period as a result of promotions (Mr. [Page 99] Bullock was promoted in 2023). [Page 99] Amounts are shown at target for each year because it is most probable at the setting of the target for the applicable performance periods that targets will be achieved. [Page 99] If payout was made at maximum levels for company performance the amounts shown would double from the targets shown, although the value of the actual payout would be dependent upon the stock price and accrued dividend equivalent units at the time of the payout. [Page 99] If payout was made at minimum levels, the amounts would be reduced to zero. [Page 99] No adjustment is made to the target shown for prior years based upon any change in probability after the target is set. [Page 99] Changes to targets resulting from promotion or demotion of a NEO are shown as awards in the year of the promotion or demotion, even though the awards may relate to a program period that began in an earlier year. [Page 99] The grant date fair values of the target awards for PSP 21 (January 2021-December 2023) granted in 2021 appear in the table in 2021, and any incremental target awards as a result of a promotion appear in the year in which they were granted. [Page 99] Actual payouts with regard to the targets for PSP 21 were approved by the HRCC at its February 2024 meeting. [Page 99] Pursuant to that approval, payouts were made in February 2024 (with values shown at fair market value on the date of settlement) to the NEOs as follows: Mr. [Page 99] Lance, 339,301 units valued at $37,453,741; Mr. [Page 99] Bullock, 106,856 units valued at $11,795,300; Ms. [Page 99] Rose, 73,017 units valued at $8,059,982; Mr. [Page 99] Olds, 65,048 units valued at $7,180,323 ; and Mr. [Page 99] Macklon, 75,201 units valued at $8,301,062. [Page 99] These amounts do not appear in the Summary Compensation Table. [Page 99] Under the terms and conditions of the awards, participants were able to make elections prior to the beginning of the performance period to defer all or a portion of the award value into the KEDCP. [Page 99] See the section on Nonqualified Deferred Compensation beginning on page 107 for further information. [Page 99] For PSPs beginning in 2012 and later settlement will be made in cash rather than unrestricted shares. [Page 99] For target awards for program periods beginning in 2013 and later, the vesting period ends shortly after the end of the performance period, except that in the cases of termination due to death, layoff, or retirement, or after disability or a change in control, the vesting period ends upon the occurrence of the exceptional termination event although the timing of settlement remains unchanged. [Page 99] For programs beginning prior to 2013, the employee may have elected, prior to the beginning of the performance period, to defer the lapsing of restrictions until after separation. [Page 99] For PSPs beginning in 2013 and later, the employee may elect, prior to the beginning of the performance period, to have some or all of the settlement value deferred into the KEDCP. [Page 99] (4) Includes amounts paid under the VCIP and VCIP amounts that were voluntarily deferred to the KEDCP. [Page 99] See the section on Nonqualified Deferred Compensation beginning on page 107 for further information. [Page 99] See also note 2 on the previous page. [Page 99] (5) Amounts represent the actuarial increase in the present value of the NEO\u2019s benefits under all pension plans maintained by ConocoPhillips determined using interest rate, discount rate, and mortality rate assumptions consistent with those used in ConocoPhillips\u2019 financial statements. [Page 99] Primarily as a result of such actuarial factors, the present value of the benefit to Mr. [Page 99] Lance decreased from 2022 to 2023 by $287,376.

[Page 100] Each additional year of service credit and pay increases will generally result in an increase in the actuarial values reported. [Page 100] This only applies to Messrs. [Page 100] Lance, Bullock, and Olds who are the only NEOs who participate in a final average earnings title of ConocoPhillips\u2019 U.S. [Page 100] pension plans. [Page 100] See Pension Benefits beginning on page 105 of this Proxy Statement for further information. [Page 100] (6) As discussed in \u201cCompensation Discussion and Analysis\u201d beginning on page 66 of this Proxy Statement, ConocoPhillips provides its executives with a number of compensation and benefit arrangements. [Page 100] The table below reflects amounts earned in 2023 under those arrangements. [Page 100] We have excluded the cost of benefits that are generally available to our U.S.-based salaried employees, such as our medical, dental, vision, life, and accident plans, disability, and health savings and flexible spending account arrangements. [Page 100] All of our NEOs are U.S.-based salaried employees. [Page 100] All Other Compensation includes the following amounts, which were determined using actual cost paid by ConocoPhillips unless otherwise noted: Name Personal Use of Company Aircraft(a) Business Related Use of Company Aircraft(b) Matching Gift Program(c) Other(d) Tax and Financial Planning(e) Expatriate(f) Executive Group Life Insurance Premiums(g) Tax Reimbursement Gross-Up(h) Matching Contributions Under the Tax-Qualified Savings Plans(i) Company Contributions to Non- Qualified Defined Contribution Plans(j) Total R.M.

[Page 100] All other NEOs are permitted to use the aircraft for preapproved personal travel. [Page 100] Amounts represent the approximate aggregate incremental cost to ConocoPhillips for personal use of the aircraft, including travel for any family member or personal guest. [Page 100] Approximate aggregate incremental cost has been determined by calculating the variable costs for each aircraft during the year, dividing that amount by the total number of miles flown by that aircraft, and multiplying the result by the miles flown for personal use during the year. [Page 100] However, where there were identifiable costs related to a particular trip \u2014 such as fuel, airport landing fees or food and lodging for aircraft personnel who remained at the location of the personal trip \u2014 those amounts are separately determined and included in the table above. [Page 100] The amounts shown include incremental costs associated with flights to the hangar or other locations without passengers (commonly referred to as \u201cdeadhead\u201d flights) arising from the non-business use of the aircraft by a NEO. [Page 100] Beginning in 2021, Mr. [Page 100] Lance has entered into aviation lease agreements with the company under which reimbursement, subject to FAA limitations, is provided for certain flights which are personal in nature. [Page 100] Amounts in the table above reflect aggregate incremental cost net of reimbursements. [Page 100] Lease reimbursements are allocated to the flight to which they relate but may be paid in a different year due to lease administration. [Page 100] (b) ConocoPhillips executives participate in community, university, and philanthropic organizations at the request of the company. [Page 100] In some cases, company aircraft are used to support these activities as well as other activities not integrally related to the performance of the executive\u2019s duties. [Page 100] When these activities are considered as not integrally and directly related to the performance of the executive\u2019s duties, we include the aggregate incremental cost to ConocoPhillips in this column. [Page 100] The same guidelines for determining approximate aggregate incremental cost as discussed in note (a) are used in determining these amounts. [Page 100] (c) ConocoPhillips maintains a Matching Gift Program, under which certain gifts by employees to qualified educational or charitable institutions are matched. [Page 100] For executives, the program matches up to $10,000 with regard to each program year. [Page 100] Administration of the program can cause us to pay more than the limit in a single fiscal year due to a lag in processing claims. [Page 100] (d) The amounts in this column represent other perquisites and personal benefits including the cost of presentations made to employees and their spouses at Company meetings or events, reimbursements for the cost of spousal and other guests attendance at such meetings or events, and the aggregate incremental cost of any other personal benefits or perquisites not integrally and directly related to the performance of the executive\u2019s duties arising from such presentations, meetings, or events, primarily food, drink and transportation. [Page 100] Also includes any aggregate incremental cost of enhanced home security, transportation security, and other protection services provided under our Comprehensive Security Program. [Page 100] As part of his duties and in addition to working in the Houston headquarters of the company, Mr. [Page 100] Olds is required to work in the company\u2019s Midland, Texas office which serves as a strategic operational hub for its Permian Basin assets. [Page 100] Approximately 840 employees are based in this office. [Page 100] While working in Midland, Mr. [Page 100] Olds lived in a company- purchased house and drove a company-leased automobile. [Page 100] The amount shown for Mr. [Page 100] Olds includes the company\u2019s actual cost of the house for the days used by Mr. [Page 100] Olds and the company\u2019s actual cost of leasing the automobile for the days used by Mr. [Page 100] Olds. [Page 100] (e) The amounts shown reflect the cost of professional advice related to tax, estate and financial planning. [Page 100] The maximum benefit in 2023 was $15,000 plus any travel-related expenses incurred by the advisor when meeting with an executive. [Page 100] No tax gross-up is provided for these costs. [Page 100] (f) Mr. [Page 100] Bullock was previously assigned in Singapore and Mr. [Page 100] Macklon was previously on the U.K. [Page 100] payroll assigned in the U.S. [Page 100] These amounts reflect net expatriate benefits under our standard policies for such service outside of the employee\u2019s home country, and these amounts include payments for increased tax costs related to such expatriate assignments and benefits. [Page 100] Amounts shown in the table above also reflect amended tax equalization and similar payments under our expatriate services policies that were made to and from, or on behalf of, the NEO that were paid or received during 2023, but apply to earnings of prior years, but which were unknown or not capable of being estimated with any reasonable degree of accuracy in prior years. [Page 100] These amounts are returned to ConocoPhillips when they are known or received through the tax reporting and filing process. [Page 100] Not included in the table are amounts less than $0 that primarily relate to tax amounts returned to ConocoPhillips in the normal course of the expatriate tax protection process that may relate to a prior period. [Page 100] The amount noted for Mr. [Page 100] Macklon would have been negative $29,112. [Page 101] 101 2024 Proxy Statement Executive Compensation Tables (g) The amounts shown reflect the aggregate incremental cost of premiums paid by ConocoPhillips for executive group life insurance (coverage equal to two times annual salary) versus the cost of basic life insurance provided to non-executive employees (coverage equal to annual salary). [Page 101] In addition, certain employees, including the NEOs, are eligible to purchase group variable universal life insurance policies at no incremental cost to ConocoPhillips. [Page 101] (h) The amounts shown are for payments by ConocoPhillips relating to certain taxes incurred by the employee. [Page 101] These taxes arise primarily when ConocoPhillips requests family members or other guests to accompany the employee to a function, and, as a result, the employee is deemed to make a personal use of company assets (for example, when a spouse accompanies an employee on a company aircraft). [Page 101] ConocoPhillips believes such expenses are appropriately characterized as a business expense, and, if the employee has imputed income in accordance with the applicable tax laws, ConocoPhillips will generally reimburse any increased tax costs. [Page 101] (i) Under the terms of its tax-qualified defined contribution plans, ConocoPhillips makes matching contributions and nonelective allocations to the accounts of its eligible employees, including the NEOs. [Page 101] (j) Under the terms of its nonqualified defined contribution plans, ConocoPhillips makes contributions to the accounts of its eligible employees, including the NEOs. [Page 101] See the narrative, table, and notes to the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation section beginning on page 107 for further information. [Page 101] Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table The Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table shows participation by the NEOs in the incentive compensation arrangements described below. [Page 101] The columns under the heading Estimated Future Payouts Under Non-Equity Incentive Plan Awards show information regarding VCIP. [Page 101] The amounts shown in the table are those applicable to the 2023 program year, using a minimum of zero and a maximum of 200 percent of VCIP target for each participant; the amounts shown do not represent actual payouts for that program year. [Page 101] Actual payouts for the 2023 program year were made in February 2024 and are shown in the Summary Compensation Table on page 98 under the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column. [Page 101] Awards are eligible to be voluntarily deferred under the KEDCP. [Page 101] The columns under the heading Estimated Future Payouts Under Equity Incentive Plan Awards show information regarding PSP. [Page 101] The amounts shown in the table are those set for 2023 compensation tied to the 2023 through 2025 program period and any promotional grants for previous performance periods and do not represent actual payouts for that program year. [Page 101] These awards accrue dividend equivalents that, during the performance period, are reinvested in additional restricted stock units and paid upon the applicable vesting of the underlying award. [Page 101] Dividend equivalents are not paid at preferential rates and are credited at the same time dividends are paid on common stock. [Page 101] Awards settled in cash are eligible to be voluntarily deferred under the KEDCP. [Page 101] For the 2023 program year under the PSP, the HRCC set the targets and granted awards at the regularly scheduled February 2023 meeting of the HRCC. [Page 101] The All Other Stock Awards column reflects awards granted under the Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program. [Page 101] The Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program awards shown were granted on the same day the target was approved, vest at the end of a three-year period, and accrue dividend equivalents that, during the performance period, are reinvested in additional restricted stock units and settle in stock upon the applicable vesting of the underlying award. [Page 101] Dividend equivalents are not paid at preferential rates and are credited at the same time dividends are paid on common stock. [Page 101] For the 2023 program year under the Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program, the HRCC set the targets and granted awards at the regularly scheduled February 2023 meeting of the HRCC.

[Page 102] In the case of Mr. [Page 102] Bullock, his promotion was effective March 1, 2023. [Page 102] (2) Threshold and maximum awards are based on the program provisions under VCIP. [Page 102] Actual awards earned can range from zero to 200 percent of the target awards for corporate performance inclusive of negative discretionary adjustments for individual performance. [Page 102] Amounts reflect estimated cash payouts under VCIP after the close of the performance period at the threshold, target, and maximum level of performance. [Page 102] The estimated amounts are calculated based on the applicable annual target and base salary for each NEO in effect for the 2023 performance period, including any salary increases during the year. [Page 102] While the program terms would also automatically adjust for salary decreases, these are not reflected in the table above. [Page 102] If threshold levels of performance are not met, then the payout can be zero. [Page 102] The HRCC also retains the discretionary authority to make negative individual performance adjustments to awards to NEOs under VCIP. [Page 102] Actual payouts under VCIP for 2023 are based on actual base salaries earned in 2023 and are reflected in the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column of the Summary Compensation Table on page 98. [Page 102] (3) Threshold and maximum awards under the PSP are based on the program provisions. [Page 102] Actual awards earned under the PSP can range from zero to 200 percent of the awards. [Page 102] Ms. [Page 102] Rose and Mr. [Page 102] Olds received an additional 10 percent initial award for PSP 23 (2023-2025) in recognition of their differential performance in 2022. [Page 102] (4) This reflects awards for the Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program. [Page 102] Executive Restricted Stock Unit awards can only be adjusted downward. [Page 102] (5) For equity incentive plan awards, these amounts represent the grant date fair value at target level under PSP as determined pursuant to FASB ASC Topic 718 and reflected in the Stock Awards column in the Summary Compensation Table on page 98. [Page 102] Actual value realized upon vesting of the PSP or Executive Restricted Stock Unit awards depends on market prices at the time of settlement for such awards. [Page 102] See the \u201cEmployee Benefit Plans\u201d section of Note 16 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in ConocoPhillips\u2019 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the relevant assumptions used in this determination.",

[Page 103] The following table reflects outstanding stock option awards and unvested and unearned stock awards (both time-based and performance-contingent) as of December 31, 2023, assuming a market value of $116.07 per share (the closing stock price of the company\u2019s common stock on December 29, 2023).

[Page 103] Under certain circumstances, the terms for exercise may be shorter, and, in certain circumstances, the options may be forfeited and cancelled. [Page 103] All awards shown in the table have associated restrictions on transferability. [Page 103] (2) The options shown in this column vested and became exercisable in 2020 or prior years (although under certain termination circumstances, the options may still be forfeited). [Page 103] Options became exercisable in one-third increments on the first, second, and third anniversaries of the grant date. [Page 103] (3) Stock awards made to the NEOs in 2023 include: (a) long-term incentive awards under the PSP; or (b) long-term time-vested awards under the Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program. [Page 103] Stock awards shown in the columns entitled Number of Shares or Units of Stock That Have Not Vested and Market Value of Shares or Units of Stock That Have Not Vested continue to have restrictions upon transferability. [Page 103] Stock awards shown reflect the closing price of ConocoPhillips common stock ($116.07), as reported on the NYSE, on December 29, 2023, the last trading day of 2023. [Page 103] The number of shares or units shown is rounded to the nearest whole share, but the related value is based on the actual number of shares (including fractional shares), with aggregate value rounded to the nearest dollar. [Page 103] Amounts include PSP awards for the performance period that ended in December 2023 (PSP 21), shown at target. [Page 103] At its February 2024, meeting, the HRCC approved final payout levels for the NEOs with regard to that performance period, as follows: Mr. [Page 103] Lance, 339,301 units; Mr. [Page 103] Bullock, 106,856 units; Ms. [Page 103] Rose, 73,017 units; Mr. [Page 103] Olds, 65,048 units; and Mr. [Page 103] Macklon, 75,201 units; see note 3 of the Summary Compensation Table. [Page 103] Under the PSP, stock awards are made in the form of restricted stock units (RSUs) or restricted stock, the former having been used in the most recent awards. [Page 103] The terms and conditions of both are substantially the same, requiring restriction on transferability until separation from employment, although for performance periods beginning after 2008 and before 2013, restrictions will lapse five years from the anniversary of the grant date unless the employee has elected prior to the beginning of the performance period to defer the lapsing of such restrictions until separation from employment. [Page 103] For performance periods beginning after 2012, restrictions will lapse three years after the grant, and awards will be settled in cash. [Page 103] Except in cases where the five-year provision applies, forfeiture is expected to occur if the separation is not the result of death, disability, layoff, or retirement after the executive has reached the age of 55 with five years of service, or after a change in control, although the HRCC has the authority to waive forfeiture. [Page 103] Restricted stock awards have voting rights and pay dividends. [Page 103] RSU awards have no voting rights. [Page 103] RSUs granted under PSP prior to 2018 pay dividend equivalents, but no dividend equivalents are paid or accrued for awards made under the PSP until after the applicable performance period has ended. [Page 103] RSUs granted under the PSP in 2018 and later accrue dividend equivalents that, during the performance period, are reinvested in additional RSUs. [Page 103] Dividends or dividend equivalents are not paid at preferential rates, and dividend equivalents are paid at the same time as dividends on common stock. [Page 103] Restricted stock held by the NEOs prior to November 17, 2001, was converted to RSUs prior to the completion of the merger of Conoco Inc. [Page 103] and Phillips Petroleum Company, with the original restrictions still in place. [Page 103] Awards for ongoing performance periods under PSP 22 (January 2022 \u2013December 2024) and PSP 23 (January 2023 \u2013December 2025)) are shown at target levels in the columns entitled Equity Incentive Plan Awards: Number of Unearned Shares, Units or Other Rights That Have Not Vested, and Equity Incentive Plan Awards: Market or Payout Value of Unearned Shares, Units or Other Rights That Have Not Vested. [Page 103] There is no assurance that these awards will be granted at, below, or above target after the end of the relevant performance periods, as the determination of whether to make an actual grant and the amount of any actual grant for NEOs is within the discretion of the HRCC. [Page 104] 104 ConocoPhillips Executive Compensation Tables Amounts also include Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program awards granted in February 2021, 2022, and 2023. [Page 104] Under the Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program, stock awards are made in the form of RSUs. [Page 104] The terms and conditions of those units require restriction on transferability, which lapse three years from the anniversary of the grant date. [Page 104] Forfeiture is expected to occur at separation from service if the separation is not the result of death, disability, layoff, or retirement after the executive has reached the age of 55 with five years of service, or after a change in control, although the HRCC has the authority to waive forfeiture. [Page 104] Upon lapse of restrictions, settlement is made in stock. [Page 104] RSU awards have no voting rights. [Page 104] Dividend equivalents, if any, on RSUs held are reinvested in additional RSUs. [Page 104] Dividend equivalents are paid at the same time and the same rate as dividends on common stock, not at a preferential rate. [Page 104] Awards under the Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program are shown in the columns entitled Number of Shares or Units of Stock That Have Not Vested. [Page 104] Amounts also include restricted stock and RSU awards granted with respect to prior periods. [Page 104] The plans and programs under which such grants were made provide that awards made in the form of restricted stock and RSUs be held in such form until the recipient retires (with respect to awards made before 2009) or the earlier of eight years or retirement (with respect to awards made from 2009 through 2012), with the possible election to hold until retirement, or three years (with regard to awards made in 2013 or later), with payouts for the last to be made in cash (unless voluntarily deferred to an account in the Key Employee Deferred Compensation Plan). [Page 104] If such awards immediately vested upon completion of the relevant performance period as is more typical for restricted stock programs, the amounts reflected in this column would be zero for awards made in years prior to 2012. [Page 104] (4) Includes 6,780 restricted shares for LTIP X \u2014 PSP I initial payout, for which restrictions lapse at retirement; 106,204 RSUs related to grants for PSP I final payout \u2014 PSP VI, for which restrictions lapse following separation from service; 71,789 RSUs for PSP VIII and PSP VIII Tail; Mr. [Page 104] Lance elected to defer lapsing of restrictions for PSP VIII and PSP VIII Tail until separation of service; 116,510 Executive RSUs related to the grant in 2021, for which restrictions lapse three years from the grant date and that will be settled in shares; 57,087 Executive RSUs related to the grant in 2022, for which restrictions lapse three years from the grant date and that will be settled in shares; 46,041 Executive RSUs related to the grant in 2023, for which restrictions lapse three years from the grant date and that will be settled in shares; and 224,703 RSUs related to grants for the PSP 21 target award. [Page 104] The actual payouts with regard to the targets for PSP 21 were approved by the HRCC at its February 2024 meeting, and, pursuant to that decision, Mr. [Page 104] Lance received a payout of 339,301 units. [Page 104] Restrictions on the PSP 21 award lapsed on February 13, 2024, and the award settled in cash, although the employee may have elected, prior to the beginning of the performance period, to have some or all of the settlement deferred into the KEDCP. [Page 104] For certain awards, Mr. [Page 104] Lance has voluntarily elected to defer the lapsing of restrictions until separation from service, and those awards continue to appear in the table. [Page 104] Subsequent elections may also impact the final timing of the payout of these awards. [Page 104] (5) Includes 24,356 RSUs related to grants for PSP I final payout \u2014 PSP VI, for which restrictions lapse following separation from service; 31,177 Executive RSUs related to the grant in 2021, for which restrictions lapse three years from grant date and that will be settled in shares; 14,191 Executive RSUs related to the grant in 2022, for which restrictions lapse three years from grant date and that will be settled in shares; 11,655 Executive RSUs related to the grant in 2023, for which restrictions lapse three years from the grant date and that will be settled in shares; and 70,766 RSUs related to grants for the PSP 21 target award. [Page 104] The actual payouts with regard to the targets for the PSP 21 award were approved by the HRCC at its February 2024 meeting, and, pursuant to that decision, Mr. [Page 104] Bullock received a payout of 106,856 units. [Page 104] Restrictions on the PSP 21 award lapsed on February 13, 2024, and the award settled in cash, although the employee may have elected, prior to the beginning of the performance period, to have some or all of the settlement deferred into the KEDCP. [Page 104] Subsequent elections may also impact the final timing of the payout of these awards. [Page 104] (6) Includes 22,792 Executive RSUs related to the grant in 2021, for which restrictions lapse three years from the program grant date and that will be settled in shares; 11,720 Executive RSUs related to the grant in 2022, for which restrictions lapse three years from the program grant date and that will be settled in shares; 9,446 Executive RSUs related to the grant in 2023, for which restrictions lapse three years from the grant date and that will be settled in shares; and 48,356 RSUs related to grants for the PSP 21 target award. [Page 104] The actual payouts with regard to the targets for PSP 21 were approved by the HRCC at its February 2024 meeting, and, pursuant to that decision, Ms. [Page 104] Rose received 73,017 units. [Page 104] Restrictions on the PSP 21 award lapsed on February 13, 2024, and the award settled in cash, although the employee may have elected, prior to the beginning of the performance period, to have some or all of the settlement deferred into the KEDCP.

            "introduction":"This section of the 2024 Proxy Statement presents the Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End table, detailing ConocoPhillips stock-based equity awards held by Named Executive Officers (NEOs) as of December 31, 2023. The table includes information on stock options, unvested stock awards, and performance-contingent awards, with a market value calculated at $116.07 per share.",
            "main_points":"The table displays the number of securities underlying unexercised options and the number of shares or units of stock that have not vested, along with their market value. It includes option awards, stock awards, and equity incentive plan awards, such as those under the Performance Share Program (PSP) and the Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program. The PSP awards for the performance period ending in December 2023 (PSP 21) are shown at target levels, with final payout levels approved by the HRCC in February 2024. The awards are subject to restrictions on transferability and potential forfeiture under certain circumstances, with varying vesting schedules and settlement methods (cash or stock).",
            "conclusion":"The equity awards provide long-term incentives to the NEOs, subject to performance metrics and vesting requirements, with the ultimate value and payout dependent on the discretion of the HRCC and the terms of the respective plans. These awards are critical components of the executive compensation structure at ConocoPhillips."

[Page 105] Pension Benefits Our defined benefit pension plan for U.S. [Page 105] based employees is the ConocoPhillips Retirement Plan (\u201cCPRP\u201d). [Page 105] The CPRP is intended to be tax-qualified under section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. [Page 105] Our NEOs also participate in the nonqualified ConocoPhillips Key Employee Supplemental Retirement Plan (\u201cKESRP\u201d). [Page 105] The CPRP consists of multiple titles with different terms, each corresponding to a different pension formula. [Page 105] NEOs are only eligible to participate in one title at any time but may have frozen benefits under one or more other titles. [Page 105] Benefits are identified by title in the table below, and all NEOs are vested in their benefits under the CPRP. [Page 105] Each title allows for payment in the form of several annuity types or a single lump sum, but all of the options are considered actuarially equivalent. [Page 105] Effective January 1, 2019, the CPRP was closed to additional benefit accrual for new hires and rehires who instead are eligible for an enhanced benefit under the ConocoPhillips Savings Plan and a related make-up plan. [Page 105] Normal retirement for all of the CPRP titles is defined as the later of age 65 or the employment termination date, but participants in Title II may receive their vested benefits upon termination of employment at any age. [Page 105] Under Title I, early retirement can occur at age 55 with five years of service. [Page 105] Under Title IV, early retirement can occur at age 50 with ten years of service. [Page 105] Under Title I, early retirement benefits are unreduced for benefits that commence at or after age 60, but are reduced by five percent per year (prorated by month) for each year before age 60 that benefits are paid. [Page 105] Under Title IV, early retirement benefits are unreduced for benefits that commence at or after age 60, but are reduced by five percent per year (prorated by month) for each year from age 50 to age 57 that benefits are paid before age 60 and four percent per year (prorated by month) for each year from age 57 that benefits are paid before age 60. [Page 105] Messrs. [Page 105] Lance, Bullock, and Olds were eligible for early retirement at the end of 2023 under the terms of Title I or Title IV, as applicable. [Page 105] The annual pension benefit under Title I and Title IV is an amount payable in the form of a single life annuity beginning at normal or early retirement equal to 1.6% multiplied by the participant\u2019s pension compensation multiplied by years of credited service, minus a Social Security benefit offset equal to 1.5% multiplied by the participant\u2019s annual primary Social Security benefit multiplied by years of credited service. [Page 105] For Title I, pension compensation is calculated using the three highest consecutive years in the last ten years before retirement. [Page 105] For Title IV, pension compensation is calculated using the higher of the highest consecutive 36- months of compensation or the highest nonconsecutive three years of compensation. [Page 106] 106 ConocoPhillips Executive Compensation Tables Eligible pension compensation is limited to the annual maximum permitted under the Internal Revenue Code and generally includes salary and annual incentive compensation and other items (such as overtime) that are not applicable to or are not material for our NEOs. [Page 106] Under Title I, if an executive receives layoff benefits, eligible pension compensation includes annualized salary for the year of layoff, rather than actual salary, and years of credited service are increased by the layoff benefit period. [Page 106] Pension benefits under Title II are based on monthly pay and interest credits to a notional cash balance account. [Page 106] Pay credits are equal to a percentage of eligible pension compensation as described above. [Page 106] Participants whose combined age and years of service total less than 44 receive a 6% pay credit, those whose combined age and years of service total 44 through 65 receive a 7% pay credit, and those whose combined age and years of service total 66 or more receive a 9% pay credit. [Page 106] Mr. [Page 106] Macklon began participating in Title II of CPRP when he transferred to the U.S. [Page 106] payroll. [Page 106] Previously while he was on the U.K. [Page 106] payroll, he participated in the ConocoPhillips Pension Plan (the \u201cU.K. [Page 106] Plan\u201d). [Page 106] The U.K. [Page 106] Plan is a U.K. [Page 106] registered plan with His Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs (\u201cHMRC\u201d). [Page 106] Mr. [Page 106] Macklon has a deferred, vested benefit under the noncontributory portion of the U.K. [Page 106] Plan. [Page 106] Under applicable provisions of the U.K. [Page 106] Plan, a member is entitled to receive full benefits upon attainment of normal pension age (60 in the case of Mr. [Page 106] Macklon) subsequent to termination. [Page 106] Early retirement may occur after reaching age 55. [Page 106] Early retirement benefits are unreduced on and after age 60, but are actuarially reduced each month before age 60 that benefits are paid. [Page 106] In general, annual pension benefits under the U.K. [Page 106] Plan are calculated as the product of 1.75% of final pensionable salary multiplied by years of credited service. [Page 106] Final pensionable salary is generally basic annual salary plus pensionable allowances earned in the 12 months before active membership in the U.K. [Page 106] Plan ends. [Page 106] The U.K. [Page 106] Plan allows participants to choose between taking a full annuity or a reduced annuity plus a lump sum allowance of up to 25 percent of the value of the benefit (capped at the greater of \u00a3268,275, or 25% of the protected lifetime allowance in effect when the allowance was prospectively eliminated in 2023). [Page 106] Both choices are actuarially equivalent. [Page 106] The KESRP is designed to replace benefits that would otherwise not be received due to certain voluntary reductions of compensation under the Key Employee Deferred Compensation Plan of ConocoPhillips (\u201cKEDCP\u201d) and to limitations contained in the Internal Revenue Code that apply to the CPRP. [Page 106] The KESRP determines a benefit without regard to such limits, and then reduces that benefit by the amount of benefit payable from the CPRP. [Page 106] Thus, in operation the combined benefits payable from the related plans for an eligible employee equal the benefit that would have been paid if there had been no KEDCP deferrals or limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. [Page 106] For participants in Title I of the CPRP, the KESRP pension compensation is calculated using the three highest annual amounts for salary and VCIP in the last ten calendar years before retirement plus the year of retirement. [Page 106] Applicable pension compensation for participants in Title II and Title IV of the CPRP, is calculated on the same basis as for the CPRP. [Page 106] Benefits under the KESRP are generally paid in a single lump sum at the later of age 55 or six months after separation from service. [Page 106] When payment is made, interest at then-current six-month Treasury-bill rates will be credited on any delayed benefits. [Page 106] Distribution may also be made upon a determination of death or disability. [Page 106] Each of the NEOs who are eligible for benefits in the KESRP is vested. [Page 106] Benefits due under the KESRP are paid from ConocoPhillips\u2019 general assets, although we also maintain grantor trusts that may be used to pay such benefits. [Page 106] The trusts and the funds held in them are assets of ConocoPhillips. [Page 106] In the event of bankruptcy or insolvency of the company, trust assets would be held for the benefit of the company\u2019s general creditors, and participants would be unsecured general creditors. [Page 106] For participants in the U.K. [Page 106] Plan, there is a plan similar to the KESRP, known as the ConocoPhillips Unfunded Pension Plan (\u201cU.K Unfunded Plan\u201d), which operates on the same principles but with respect to limits imposed through HMRC on registered plans like the U.K. [Page 106] Plan. [Page 106] Mr. [Page 106] Macklon is a participant in the U.K. [Page 106] Unfunded Plan with regard to the time he worked in the U.K. [Page 106] from September 1, 2013 to December 31, 2016, at which time he transferred to the U.S. [Page 106] payroll (Mr. [Page 106] Macklon was a participant in the U.K. [Page 106] Plan prior to September 1, 2013). [Page 106] Mr. [Page 106] Macklon is vested in his benefit under the U.K. [Page 106] Unfunded Plan, and such benefit is payable when he attains 55 years of age in the form of a lump sum, or series of lump sums payable over a five- or ten-year period. [Page 107] 107 2024 Proxy Statement Executive Compensation Tables Except where otherwise noted, assumptions used in calculating the present value of accumulated benefits in the table are found in Note 16 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in ConocoPhillips\u2019 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

[Page 107] Mr. [Page 107] Lance\u2019s Title I benefit is calculated by including his 16 years of service with ARCO but then reducing the resulting benefit by amounts payable by the BP Retirement Accumulation Plan which remains liable for his benefits accumulated while working for ARCO Alaska. [Page 107] This benefit including ARCO service and the offset is payable because it exceeds the pension otherwise payable taking into account only ConocoPhillips service (and without the BP Retirement Accumulation Plan offset). [Page 107] (2) Ms. [Page 107] Rose became an employee of ConocoPhillips on September 4, 2018. [Page 107] Under Title II, and related provisions in the KESRP, Ms. [Page 107] Rose received pay credits equal to seven percent of her pension compensation in 2023 because her combined age and years of service was 62. [Page 107] (3) Mr. [Page 107] Macklon became an employee of ConocoPhillips on September 2, 1991. [Page 107] Under Title II, and related provisions in the KESRP, Mr. [Page 107] Macklon received pay credits equal to 9 percent of his pension compensation in 2023 because his combined age and years of service exceed 65. [Page 107] Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Our NEOs participate in two nonqualified deferred compensation plans, the Key Employee Deferred Compensation Plan of ConocoPhillips (\u201cKEDCP\u201d) and the Defined Contribution Make-Up Plan of ConocoPhillips (\u201cDCMP\u201d). [Page 107] The KEDCP permits participants to defer up to 50% of base salary, 100% of VCIP and 100% of cash settled PSP awards for performance periods ending in 2015 or later. [Page 107] Each of the NEOs is eligible to participate in, and is fully vested in, the KEDCP. [Page 107] Under the KEDCP, participants may elect for payment of deferred amounts to begin one(a) to five years after separation from service or on a specified date.(b) Payments may be received in a single lump sum payment or in annual, semiannual, or quarterly installment payments over a period of one to 15 years. [Page 107] The DCMP is a nonqualified restoration plan under which ConocoPhillips makes certain employer contributions that cannot be made in the qualified ConocoPhillips Savings Plan (\u201cCPSP\u201d), a defined contribution 401(k) plan, due to certain voluntary reductions of compensation under the KEDCP or due to compensation limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. [Page 107] Employees make no contributions to the DCMP, and each of the NEOs is fully vested in the DCMP. [Page 107] Under the DCMP, participants may elect for payment of deferred amounts to begin one(a) to five years after separation from service. [Page 107] Payments may be received in a single lump sum payment or in annual, semiannual, or quarterly payments over a period of one to 15 years. [Page 107] (a) Different distribution rules applied to amounts deferred and vested prior to 2005. [Page 107] For these amounts payment could begin as early as immediately following separation from service and certain changes to distribution elections are permitted. [Page 107] For amounts deferred under an election made prior to 2020, payments could begin as early as six months following separation from service. [Page 107] (b) A date certain payment election is not permitted for salary earned before 2015.",

[Page 108] Participants may make changes in the notional investments at any time. [Page 108] Because each participant chooses the notional investment fund for deferred amounts and may change allocations, the return on the investment will depend on how well each underlying fund performs during the period the participant chose it as an investment vehicle. [Page 108] The aggregate performance of such investment vehicle is reflected in the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table under the column Aggregate Earnings in Last Fiscal Year. [Page 108] Benefits due under each of the plans discussed above are paid from ConocoPhillips\u2019 general assets, although we also maintain grantor trusts that may be used to pay benefits under the plans. [Page 108] The trusts and the funds held in them are assets of ConocoPhillips. [Page 108] In the event of bankruptcy or insolvency of the company, trust assets would be held for the benefit of the company\u2019s general creditors, and participants would be unsecured general creditors.

[Page 108] (3) Reflects contributions by ConocoPhillips under the DCMP relating to eligible compensation earned in 2023 (included in the All Other Compensation column of the Summary Compensation Table on page 98 for 2023). [Page 108] The following amounts were contributed in January 2024, relating to company contributions under the DCMP for 2023 service: for Mr. [Page 108] Lance, $43,775; for Mr. [Page 108] Bullock, $25,325; for Ms. [Page 108] Rose, $23,800; for Mr. [Page 108] Olds, $21,264; and for Mr. [Page 108] Macklon, $22,751. [Page 108] In addition, contributions by ConocoPhillips under the DCMP in earlier years (included in the All Other Compensation column of the Summary Compensation Table for those respective years) were as follows: in 2022 for Mr. [Page 108] Lance, $165,700; for Mr. [Page 108] Bullock, $77,827; for Ms. [Page 108] Rose, $73,317; for Mr. [Page 108] Olds, $54,680; for Mr. [Page 108] Macklon, $65,225; in 2021 for Mr. [Page 108] Lance, $133,125; for Mr. [Page 108] Bullock, $64,958; for Ms. [Page 108] Rose, $58,497; for Mr. [Page 108] Macklon, $55,569.

[Page 108] This also includes contributions by ConocoPhillips made in January 2024, allocated to 2023. [Page 108] See note 3 above. [Page 109] 109 2024 Proxy Statement Executive Compensation Tables Executive Severance and Changes in Control Salary and other compensation for our NEOs is set by the HRCC, as described in the \u201cCompensation Discussion and Analysis\u201d beginning on page 66 of this Proxy Statement. [Page 109] These officers may participate in ConocoPhillips\u2019 employee benefit plans and programs for which they are eligible, in accordance with their terms. [Page 109] The amounts earned by the NEOs for 2023 appear in the various Executive Compensation Tables beginning on page 98 of this Proxy Statement. [Page 109] After separating from service each of our NEOs is expected to receive amounts earned while employed unless the executive voluntarily resigns prior to becoming retirement-eligible or is terminated for cause. [Page 109] Such amounts include: \u2022 VCIP compensation earned during the fiscal year; \u2022 Grants pursuant to the PSP for the most-recently completed performance period and ongoing performance periods in which the executive participated for at least one year; \u2022 Previously granted restricted stock and restricted stock units; \u2022 Vested stock option grants under the Stock Option Program; \u2022 Amounts contributed and vested under our defined contribution plans; and \u2022 Amounts accrued and vested under our retirement plans. [Page 109] While normal retirement age under our benefit plans is 65, early retirement provisions allow benefits at earlier ages if vesting requirements are met, as discussed in the sections of this Proxy Statement titled Pension Benefits and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation. [Page 109] For our compensation programs (VCIP, Stock Option Program, Executive RSU Program, and PSP), early retirement is generally defined to be termination at or after the age of 55 with five years of service. [Page 109] As of December 31, 2023, Messrs. [Page 109] Lance and Bullock and Ms. [Page 109] Rose had met the early retirement criteria. [Page 109] Messrs. [Page 109] Macklon and Olds, who were under the age of 55, and had not met the early retirement criteria at such date. [Page 109] In addition, specific severance arrangements for executive officers, including the NEOs, are provided under two severance plans: (1) the ConocoPhillips Executive Severance Plan (\u201cCPESP\u201d), which is available to a limited number of senior executives; and (2) the ConocoPhillips Key Employee Change in Control Severance Plan (\u201cCICSP\u201d), which is also available to a limited number of senior executives but only on or following change in control. [Page 109] These arrangements are described below. [Page 109] Executives are not entitled to participate in both plans as a result of a single event. [Page 109] For example, executives receiving benefits under the CICSP would not be entitled to benefits potentially payable under the CPESP relating to the event giving rise to benefits under the CICSP. [Page 110] 110 ConocoPhillips Executive Compensation Tables ConocoPhillips Executive Severance Plan The CPESP covers executives in salary grades generally corresponding to vice president and higher and is incorporated by reference to Exhibit 10.47 to the Annual Report of ConocoPhillips on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021; File No. [Page 110] 001-32395. [Page 110] Under the CPESP, if ConocoPhillips terminates a plan participant other than for cause, as defined in the plan, then upon executing a general release of liability and, if requested, an agreement not to compete with ConocoPhillips, the participant will be entitled to: \u2022 A lump-sum cash payment equal to one-and-a-half or two times the sum of the employee\u2019s base salary and current target VCIP award; \u2022 For executives actively participating in the ConocoPhillips Retirement Plan (CPRP) and ConocoPhillips Key Employee Supplemental Retirement Plan (KESRP), a lump-sum cash payment equal to the present value of the increase in pension benefits that would result from the crediting of an additional one-and-a-half or two years to the employee\u2019s number of years of age and service under the applicable defined benefit pension formula under the plans; \u2022 A lump-sum cash payment equal to ConocoPhillips\u2019 cost of certain welfare benefits for an additional one-and-a-half or two years; \u2022 Continued eligibility for a pro rata portion of the annual VCIP for the year of termination; and \u2022 Treatment as a layoff under our various compensation and equity programs. [Page 110] Generally, layoff treatment will allow full or partial vesting of awards previously made and continued eligibility under ongoing ConocoPhillips programs. [Page 110] Thus, Executive RSU awards would vest partially (for grants 6-12 months before the layoff) or fully (for grants more than 12 months before the layoff), and the executive would remain eligible for a pro rata proportion of awards attributable to ongoing performance periods under the PSP in which the executive had participated for at least one year. [Page 110] ConocoPhillips may amend or terminate the CPESP at any time. [Page 110] Amounts payable under the CPESP will be offset by any payments or benefits that are payable to the severed employee under any other plan, policy, or program of ConocoPhillips relating to severance, and amounts may also be reduced in the event of willful and bad faith conduct demonstrably injurious to ConocoPhillips, monetarily or otherwise, or, if required by law to be \u201cclawed back,\u201d such as may be the case in certain circumstances under the ConocoPhillips Clawback Policy. [Page 110] ConocoPhillips Key Employee Change in Control Severance Plan The CICSP covers executives in salary grades generally corresponding to vice president and higher and is incorporated by reference to Exhibit 10.20.1 to the Annual Report of ConocoPhillips on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021; File No. [Page 110] 001-32395. [Page 110] Under the CICSP, if within two years after a \u201cchange in control\u201d of ConocoPhillips, a participant is terminated by ConocoPhillips other than for cause, or by the participant for good reason (as such terms are defined in the plan), upon executing a general release of liability, the participant will be entitled to: \u2022 A lump-sum cash payment equal to two or three times the sum of the employee\u2019s base salary and the higher of current target VCIP compensation or the previous two years\u2019 average VCIP compensation; \u2022 For executives actively participating in the CPRP and KESRP, a lump-sum cash payment equal to the present value of the increase in pension benefits that would result from crediting an additional two or three years to the employee\u2019s number of years of age and service under the applicable defined benefit pension formula under the plans; \u2022 A lump-sum cash payment equal to ConocoPhillips\u2019 cost of certain welfare benefits for an additional two or three years; and \u2022 Continued eligibility for a pro rata portion of the annual VCIP compensation for the year of termination. [Page 110] Excise tax gross-up benefits are not available under the CICSP. [Page 110] Upon a change in control, awards that an acquirer assumes or substitutes will be subject to accelerated vesting only following both the change in control and a qualifying termination of employment. [Page 110] A qualifying termination of employment includes involuntary termination not-for-cause or voluntary termination for good reason. [Page 110] Participants will continue to be able to exercise stock options for their remaining terms (up to 10 years from the date of grant). [Page 111] 111 2024 Proxy Statement Executive Compensation Tables After a change in control, the CICSP may not be amended or terminated if such amendment would be adverse to the interests of any eligible employee, without the employee\u2019s written consent. [Page 111] Amounts payable under the plan will be offset by any payments or benefits that are payable to the severed employee under any other plan, policy, or program of ConocoPhillips relating to severance, and amounts may also be reduced in the event of willful and bad faith conduct demonstrably injurious to ConocoPhillips, monetarily or otherwise, or if required by law to be \u201cclawed back,\u201d such as may be the case in certain circumstances under the ConocoPhillips Clawback Policy. [Page 111] Quantification of Severance Payments After separating from service each of our NEOs is expected to receive amounts earned during their period of employment unless they voluntarily resign prior to becoming retirement-eligible or are terminated for-cause. [Page 111] The following tables reflect the amount of incremental compensation payable in excess of the items listed above to each of our NEOs in the event of involuntary not-for-cause termination, termination following a change in control (\u201cCIC\u201d) (either involuntarily without cause or for good reason), and in the event of the death or disability of the executive. [Page 111] The amounts shown below assume that such termination was effective as of December 31, 2023, and thus include amounts earned through such time, and are estimates of the amounts that would be paid out to the executives upon their termination. [Page 111] Amounts related to Health and Welfare benefits are based on current ConocoPhillips benefit programs. [Page 111] The actual amounts to be paid out can only be determined at the time of an executive\u2019s separation from ConocoPhillips. [Page 111] In the event of a for-cause termination, the HRCC can suspend the right to exercise, refuse to honor the exercise of awards already requested, or cancel awards granted if an NEO engages in any activity determined to be detrimental to ConocoPhillips. [Page 111] In addition, the NEO\u2019s incentive compensation is subject to the ConocoPhillips Clawback Policy (see page 95 for more information).

[Page 113] As discussed in the narrative preceding the tables above, the amounts shown indicate the difference in compensation arising from the stated type of termination in comparison to a voluntary resignation. [Page 113] A NEO who voluntarily resigns before reaching the retirement age and service eligibility threshold contained in those equity awards and compensation programs (generally age 55 with 5 years of service) would not earn awards for ongoing performance periods under the VCIP, the PSP, the Executive RSU Program, or the Stock Option Program (as applicable), and would lose prior awards under the PSP and the Executive RSU Program (or other restricted stock or RSUs) and stock options. [Page 113] For a NEO who has reached retirement eligibility under those programs, a voluntary resignation would be deemed a retirement, and thus would not typically result in loss of those awards. [Page 113] However, before the awards are delivered as cash or stock (including upon the exercise of an option), the awards remain at risk, even for a NEO who has reached retirement eligibility. [Page 113] If ConocoPhillips were to invoke the detrimental activity clause, amounts that would normally be paid to a retirement-eligible NEO in connection with a voluntary resignation would instead be forfeited. [Page 114] 114 ConocoPhillips Executive Compensation Tables * Notes Applicable to All Termination Tables \u2014 Benefits that would be available generally to all or substantially all salaried employees on the U.S. [Page 114] payroll are not included in the amounts shown on the previous page. [Page 114] In preparing the tables, we made the following assumptions: \u2022 Base Salary \u2014 In the event of an involuntary not-for-cause termination not related to a change in control (\u201cregular involuntary termination\u201d), the amount reflects two times base salary. [Page 114] In the event of an involuntary not-for-cause or good reason termination related to a change in control (\u201cCIC termination\u201d), the amount reflects three times base salary. [Page 114] \u2022 Short-Term Incentives \u2014 In the event of a regular involuntary termination, the amount reflects two times the current VCIP target. [Page 114] In the event of a CIC termination, the amount reflects three times the current VCIP target or three times the average of the prior two VCIP payouts, whichever is greater. [Page 114] \u2022 Variable Cash Incentive Program \u2014 In the event of a regular involuntary termination or a CIC termination, the amount reflects the employee\u2019s pro rata current VCIP target. [Page 114] Targets for VCIP are for a full year and are pro rata for the NEOs based on time spent in their respective positions. [Page 114] \u2022 PSP and RSUs \u2014 For the performance periods related to PSP, amounts for the January 2021 \u2013 December 2023 period reflect actual payout amounts that were awarded in February 2024, except in the event of a CIC termination, the amounts reflect the higher of target or actual payout, as the award cannot be reduced following a change in control. [Page 114] Amounts for other ongoing PSP performance periods are shown at target, including any adjustments for promotion or demotion made since the target awards were granted. [Page 114] For awards under the Executive RSU Program, amounts reflect actual units granted. [Page 114] For restricted stock units awarded under PSP and Executive RSU Program, amounts reflect the closing price of ConocoPhillips common stock on December 29, 2023 (the last trading day of 2023), as reported on the NYSE ($116.07). [Page 114] \u2022 Incremental Retirement Values \u2014 For all NEOs, the amounts reflect the single sum, discounted to a present value, of the increment due to an additional two years of age and service with associated pension compensation in the event of a regular involuntary termination (three years in the event of a CIC termination), regardless of whether the value is provided directly through a defined benefit plan or through the relevant severance plan. [Page 115] 2024 Proxy Statement 115 CEO Pay Ratio ConocoPhillips\u2019 compensation and benefits philosophy and the overall structure of our compensation and benefit programs are designed to reward all employees who contribute to our success. [Page 115] We strive to ensure the compensation of every employee reflects their talents, skills, responsibilities, and experience and is competitive within our peer group. [Page 115] Compensation and benefits are benchmarked and set to be market-competitive in the employees\u2019 home payroll country. [Page 115] Under rules adopted pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, ConocoPhillips is required to calculate and disclose the total compensation paid to its median employee, as well as the ratio of total compensation paid to the median employee as compared to the total compensation paid to the CEO. [Page 115] The paragraphs that follow describe our methodology and the resulting CEO pay ratio. [Page 115] The ratio of pay of the CEO compared to that of the median employee was approximately 101 to one in 2023. [Page 115] The annual total compensation of the CEO was $20,789,282. [Page 115] The estimated median of the annual total compensation of all ConocoPhillips employees other than the CEO, as represented by the annual total compensation of a median employee, was $205,547. [Page 115] The compensation of the CEO and the median employee were determined using the same rules we followed in preparing the Summary Compensation Table on page 98, except the compensation of the CEO and median employee were adjusted to include nondiscriminatory health and welfare benefits totaling $18,609 and $16,764, respectively. [Page 115] ConocoPhillips had approximately 10,045 employees worldwide (including intermittent and temporary employees) as of the determination date (December 31, 2023). [Page 115] To identify the \u201cmedian employee,\u201d we excluded employees from six countries, representing in total approximately 2.3 percent, or 233 employees worldwide. [Page 115] After excluding such employees and the CEO, we determined the pay ratio using the remaining approximately 9,811 employees. [Page 115] The chart below shows the countries from which employees were excluded and the approximate number of employees from each such country. [Page 115] Payroll Country Excluded Number of Employees Excluded Malaysia 86 China 81 Singapore 31 Qatar 24 Libya 9 Japan 2 For the remaining employees, we used a consistently applied compensation measure that management believes reasonably reflects the annual compensation of employees and includes elements of compensation distributed widely among employees. [Page 115] Those elements were base salary, overtime, annual incentive compensation (VCIP) at target, equity awards, and certain country-specific allowances. [Page 115] We used data as of December 31, 2023, to identify ConocoPhillips employees and to determine the consistently applied compensation measure for those employees. [Page 115] Data not denominated in U.S. [Page 115] dollars was converted to U.S. [Page 115] dollars using an average monthly conversion rate for each denomination during 2023. [Page 115] Data came from ConocoPhillips\u2019 payroll records. [Page 115] We did not make any adjustments to the data to account for differences in cost of living in any of the countries in which we have employees. [Page 115] The SEC rules for identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee\u2019s annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices. [Page 115] Accordingly, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates, and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios. [Page 116] 116 ConocoPhillips 116 Pay Versus Performance Under rules adopted pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, ConocoPhillips is required to calculate and disclose in a tabular format the \u201cCompensation Actually Paid\u201d (\u201cCAP\u201d) to the CEO and average CAP to all other NEOs. [Page 116] The rules also require ConocoPhillips to disclose in the table the most important other financial performance measure that is measured over the most recently completed year and that is used by the company to link company performance and compensation (as reflected in CAP) to the NEOs for that year. [Page 116] We have determined that one-year relative Adjusted ROCE used for purposes of evaluating the VCIP payout (see \u201cMeasuring Performance \u2014 Performance Peer Group\u201d on page 83) is such measure for 2023. [Page 116] Compensation decisions at ConocoPhillips are made in accordance with the philosophy and process described in the \u201cCompensation Discussion and Analysis\u201d beginning on page 66 of this Proxy Statement. [Page 116] CAP is a supplemental measure defined by rules adopted pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act and does not necessarily reflect the value actually realized by our executives. [Page 116] CAP does not replace the performance measures or philosophy and strategy of compensation-setting discussed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis (see pages 66-96).

[Page 117] The \u201cservice cost\u201d is the actuarial present value of defined benefit pensions that is attributable to services rendered during the year. [Page 117] See \u201cPension Benefits\u201d starting on page 105 for a description of the formulas for the pension earned each year. [Page 117] b. [Page 117] The \u201cprior service cost\u201d is the total additional cost of defined benefit pension benefits for prior years that is attributed to amendments during the year. [Page 117] No such amendments were adopted effective in any of the years shown. [Page 117] c. [Page 117] Amounts shown are based on the fair value of awards as determined in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. [Page 117] See the \u201cEmployee Benefit Plans\u201d section of Note 16 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in ConocoPhillips\u2019 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the relevant assumptions used in this determination. [Page 117] Amounts in the CAP Reconciliation Table (other than totals shown in the first and last rows) are actual amounts rounded to the nearest dollar, and the total CAP is the sum of the amounts shown. [Page 117] In the following footnotes award descriptions are rounded to the nearest share, and fair values are rounded to the nearest penny. [Page 117] d. [Page 117] Includes PSP and ERSU award units granted during the year and unvested at year-end including award units related to dividend equivalents on outstanding unvested awards reinvested in 2023, each with a fair value of $116.68 as of December 29, 2023 (the last trading day of 2023). [Page 117] In addition, the incremental value includes projected PSP award units related to the 2021 PSP grant as adjusted for actual performance above target through December 31, 2023. [Page 117] For these projected 2021 PSP awards above target, the incremental fair value as of December 29, 2023, equals $116.68 per share because the 2021 PSP award only included target shares at the end of the prior year. [Page 117] The 2023 PSP awards and related reinvested dividend equivalents are shown at target for the year of grant because that is the probable payout as of the end of that year. [Page 117] The 2021 PSP awards vesting and settling in 2024 are adjusted for actual performance because that is the probable payout based on performance through the end of the performance period (ending December 31, 2023) even though the HRCC retained the discretion to adjust the payout until the time of settlement in February of 2024. [Page 117] e.

[Page 118] Includes the average of the Non-CEO NEOs\u2019 year-end fair value of PSP and ERSU awards granted during the year and unvested at year end, including award units related to dividend equivalents on outstanding unvested awards reinvested in 2023, each with a fair value of $116.68 as of December 29, 2023 (the last trading day of 2023). [Page 118] In addition, the average incremental value includes projected PSP award units related to the 2021 PSP grant as adjusted for actual performance above target through December 31, 2023. [Page 118] For these projected 2021 PSP awards above target, the average incremental fair value as of December 29, 2023, equals $116.68 per share because the 2021 PSP award only included target shares at the end of the prior year. [Page 118] The 2023 PSP awards and related reinvested dividend equivalents are shown at target for the year of grant because that is the probable payout as of the end of that year. [Page 118] The 2021 PSP awards vesting and settling in 2024 are adjusted for actual performance because that is the probable payout based on performance through the end of the performance period (ending December 31, 2023) even though the HRCC retained the discretion to adjust the payout until the time of settlement in February of 2024. [Page 118] i. [Page 118] Includes the average vesting date fair value of equity awards granted and vested during the year including ERSU award units granted in 2023 for which restrictions were lapsed on November 30, 2023, to satisfy required tax withholding, with a fair value of $115.17 as of the vesting date, and award units related to dividend equivalents on outstanding 2020 ERSU and PSP awards that were reinvested in 2023 and that vested February 19, 2023, with a fair value of $104.92 as of the trading day immediately preceding the vesting date. [Page 118] j. [Page 118] Includes the average incremental reduction in fair value of unvested awards as of December 31, 2023, which were granted in previous years, including restricted stock units related to grants for PSP I final payout\u2014PSP VI, for which restrictions lapse following separation from service; restricted stock units related to ERSU awards granted in 2021, for which restrictions lapse three years from the grant date; restricted stock units related to ERSU awards granted in 2022, for which restrictions lapse three years from the grant date; PSP award units related to the grant in 2021 based on initial target; and PSP award units related to the grant in 2022 based on initial target. [Page 118] For these awards, the negative change in the average fair value equals the average aggregate number of shares multiplied by minus $0.43, which is $116.68 (the fair value of the company\u2019s common stock as of December 29, 2023) less $117.11 (the fair value of the company\u2019s common stock as of December 30, 2022).

[Page 118] Includes the average incremental reduction in fair value of awards vesting in 2023, including PSP award units related to the grant in 2020 that settled in cash based on performance as approved by the HRCC at its February 2023 meeting and restricted stock units related to ERSU awards granted in 2020 that vested and settled in stock on February 19, 2023. [Page 118] For these awards, the negative change in the average fair value equals the average aggregate number of shares multiplied by minus $12.19, which is $104.92 (the fair value of the company\u2019s common stock as of the trading date immediately preceding the February 19, 2023, vesting date) less $117.11 (the fair value of the company\u2019s common stock as of December 30, 2022).

[Page 118] The amount shown in 2021 is the cumulative value of that hypothetical investment (with all dividends reinvested) as of December 31, 2021. [Page 118] The amount shown in 2022 is the cumulative value of that hypothetical investment (with all dividends reinvested) as of December 30, 2022 (the last trading day in 2022). [Page 118] The amount shown in 2023 is the cumulative value of that hypothetical investment (with all dividends reinvested) as of December 29, 2023 (the last trading day in 2023). [Page 118] (6) Peer Group TSR shown for 2020 is the value as of December 31, 2020, of a hypothetical investment of $100 in the stock of our performance peer group on December 31, 2019, with all dividends reinvested. [Page 118] The amount shown in 2021 is the cumulative value of that hypothetical investment (with all dividends reinvested) as of December 31, 2021. [Page 118] The amount shown in 2022 is the cumulative value of that hypothetical investment (with all dividends reinvested) as of December 30, 2022 (the last trading day in 2022). [Page 118] The amount shown in 2023 is the cumulative value of that hypothetical investment (with all dividends reinvested) as of December 29, 2023 (the last trading day in 2023). [Page 118] For this purpose and for all years shown in the table, our performance peer group consists of APA Corporation, Chevron Corporation, Devon Energy Corporation, EOG Resources, Inc., ExxonMobil Corporation, Hess Corporation, Occidental Petroleum Corporation, and Pioneer Natural Resources (see \u201cMeasuring Performance \u2014 Performance Peer Group\u201d on page 83 for a description of how we select our performance peer group), and Peer Group TSR is weighted according to each peer\u2019s stock market capitalization at the beginning of each annual period. [Page 118] While TSR for our peer group includes the S&P 500 Total Return Index for purposes of certain compensation decisions as discussed in \u201cMeasuring Performance \u2014 Performance Peer Group\u201d on page 83, in accordance with SEC regulations the S&P 500 Total Return Index is not included in Peer Group TSR as shown in the table above. [Page 118] In October 2020, Chevron Corporation acquired Noble Energy, Inc. [Page 118] Prior to the acquisition, Noble Energy, Inc. [Page 118] was a member of our performance peer group, but after the acquisition, we retained only the combined company for the entire period so that Noble Energy, Inc. [Page 118] effectively ceased to be a member of the peer group retroactive to January 1, 2020. [Page 118] In 2023, we updated our performance peer group, removing Marathon Oil Corporation and adding Pioneer, to better align with our business and market capitalization. [Page 118] If we had not made these changes, the cumulative peer group TSR shown in the table above would have been $66.50 for 2020, $105.36 for 2021, $183.13 for 2022, and $167.11 for 2023. [Page 118] (7) Relative Adjusted ROCE is measured as a percentile rank relative to peers over a one-year period as described in \"Process for Determining Executive Compensation \u2014 Financial (VCIP and PSP)\" and \"Components of Executive Compensation \u2014 Performance-Based Pay Programs\" on pages 82 and 75.

[Page 120] Performance-based equity grants under the PSP are the largest individual component of target compensation for the NEOs (see \u201cPhilosophy and Principles of our Executive Compensation Program \u2014 Pay for Performance\u201d on page 73). [Page 120] One-year relative Adjusted ROCE is used for purposes of evaluating VCIP payouts for 2020-2023 (see \u201cProcess for Determining Executive Compensation \u2014 Financial (VCIP and PSP)\u201d on page 82), and was selected for comparison because it complies with SEC guidance that indicates multi-year performance measures should not be used in the Tabular List of Performance Measures or as the company-selected measure in the Pay Versus Performance Table. [Page 120] For purposes of this chart, relative Adjusted ROCE is calculated as described in footnote (7) on page 118.

[Page 125] Stockholder Proposals We expect Items 4 \u2013 5 to be presented by stockholders at the Annual Meeting. [Page 125] Following SEC rules, other than minor formatting changes, we are reprinting the stockholder proposals and supporting statements, including any graphics, as they were submitted to us. [Page 125] We take no responsibility for them. [Page 125] Upon oral or written request to the Secretary at the address listed under How to Reach Our Corporate Secretary on page 129, we will provide the shareholdings (to our company\u2019s knowledge) of the proponents of any stockholder proposal presented at the Annual Meeting. [Page 125] Item 4: Stockholder Proposal \u2014 Simple Majority Vote Kenneth Steiner, 14 Stoner Ave., 2M, Great Neck, NY 11021, has notified ConocoPhillips that he intends to present the following proposal at the Annual Meeting. [Page 125] Mr. [Page 125] Steiner has indicated that he holds the requisite number of shares of ConocoPhillips common stock in accordance with Rule 14a-8 requirements. [Page 125] What am I Voting On? [Page 125] Stockholders are being asked to vote on the following resolution: Proposal 4 \u2013 Simple Majority Vote Shareholders request that our board take each step necessary so that each voting requirement in our charter and bylaws (that is explicit or implicit due to default to state law) that calls for a greater than simple majority vote be replaced by a requirement for a majority of the votes cast for and against applicable proposals, or a simple majority in compliance with applicable laws. [Page 125] If necessary this means the closest standard to a majority of the votes cast for and against such proposals consistent with applicable laws. [Page 125] This includes making the necessary changes in plain English. [Page 125] Shareholders are willing to pay a premium for shares of companies that have excellent corporate governance. [Page 125] Supermajority voting requirements have been found to be one of 6 entrenching mechanisms that are negatively related to company performance according to \u201cWhat Matters in Corporate Governance\u201d by Lucien Bebchuck, Alma Cohen and Allen Ferrell of the Harvard Law School. [Page 125] Supermajority requirements are used to block initiatives supported by most shareowners but opposed by a status quo management. [Page 125] This proposal topic won from 74% to 88% support at Weyerhaeuser, Alcoa, Waste Management, Goldman Sachs, FirstEnergy, McGraw-Hill and Macy\u2019s. [Page 125] These votes would have been higher than 74% to 88% if more shareholders had access to independent proxy voting advice. [Page 125] This proposal topic also received overwhelming 98%-support each at the 2023 annual meetings of American Airlines (AAL) and The Carlyle Group (CG). [Page 125] This proposal topic won 99% ConocoPhillips support as a shareholder proposal at the 2021 annual meeting. [Page 125] The next step was to get binding shareholder approval as a Board of Directors proposal which required 80% approval from every last share of ConocoPhillips stock. [Page 125] The outcome was a greatly disappointing narrow failure as the BOD proposal received \u201conly\u201d 79% approval at the 2022 COP annual meeting. [Page 125] 2024 Proxy Statement 125 [Page 126] If ConocoPhillips Lead Director Robert Niblock had made a small effort to get an extra 1% shareholder vote this proposal topic would have been approved in 2022. [Page 126] This narrow failure is evidence that Mr. [Page 126] Niblock does not give priority to the best interests of shareholders and should thus be replaced as Lead Director. [Page 126] It will now take at least until 2025 to adopt this proposal topic, with its 99% ConocoPhillips shareholder approval, that could have been easily adopted in 2022. [Page 126] Please vote yes: Simple Majority Vote \u2013 Proposal 4 What vote is required to approve this proposal? [Page 126] Approval of this proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal. [Page 126] WHAT DOES THE BOARD RECOMMEND? [Page 126] Our Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws impose heightened voting requirements for a number of core governance items, including \u201csupermajority voting requirements\u201d to amend sections of such documents. [Page 126] The Board believes that there are advantages and disadvantages of maintaining the current voting requirements, and there are also advantages and disadvantages to eliminating them. [Page 126] Accordingly, the Board will support the stockholder proposal and, provided there is sufficient stockholder support, take steps to implement the proposal in the future. [Page 126] FOR The Board recommends you vote FOR the stockholder proposal regarding a simple majority vote. [Page 126] 126 ConocoPhillips Item 4: Stockholder Proposal \u2014 Simple Majority Vote [Page 127] Item 5: Stockholder Proposal \u2014 Revisit Pay Incentives for GHG Emission Reductions National Legal and Policy Center (NLPC), located at 107 Park Washington Court, Falls Church, Virginia 22046, has notified ConocoPhillips that they intend to present the following proposal at the Annual Meeting. [Page 127] NLPC has indicated that it holds the requisite number of shares of ConocoPhillips common stock in accordance with Rule 14a-8 requirements. [Page 127] What am I Voting On? [Page 127] Stockholders are being asked to vote on the following resolution: Whereas: The \u201cscientific consensus\u201d1 2 claims anthropogenically-driven climate change will result in catastrophic impacts to the environment, to the planet, and to humans. [Page 127] However, research increasingly shows worst-case scenarios are unlikely, and the potential consequences of carbon dioxide emissions (aka \u201cplant food\u201d) have been greatly overstated.3 For example: \u2022 Corporate climate policy is often guided by the Paris Agreement, which is heavily informed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.4 These targets are neither legally binding nor legitimized by scientific evidence. [Page 127] \u2022 The IPCC\u2019s most extreme scenario unrealistically assumes a return to a previous era of unrestricted fossil fuel usage and heavy reliance on coal power.5 This extreme scenario is unlikely now that most nations have climate policies in place.6 \u2022 Regarding catastrophic scenarios that are highly unlikely but are treated as the expectation, \u201cthe media then often amplifies this message, sometimes without communicating the nuances. [Page 127] This results in further confusion regarding probable emissions outcomes, because many climate researchers are not familiar with the details of these scenarios in the energy-modeling literature.\u201d7 \u2022 These apocalyptic predictions have been repeatedly proven false.8 Climate models used to predict future events \u201cmay be overly sensitive to carbon dioxide increases and therefore project future warming that is unrealistically high.\u201d9 \u2022 When given historical data, climate models project impossibly high temperatures that are inconsistent with fossil evidence\u2014yet they\u2019re still used by the IPCC. [Page 127] \u2022 Hydrocarbons are reliable and cost-efficient. [Page 127] Renewable energy will not replace hydrocarbons in the near future, if ever.10 ConocoPhillips Company\u2019s (\u201cConocoPhillips\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) competitors are betting big on continued demand for oil and gas.11 1 https:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2225-1154\/11\/11\/215 2 https:\/\/nypost.com\/2023\/08\/09\/climate-scientist-admits-the-overwhelming-consensus-is-manufactured\/ 3 https:\/\/judithcurry.com\/2023\/03\/28\/uns-climate-panic-is-more-politics-than-science\/ 4 https:\/\/www.ipcc.ch\/sr15\/faq\/faq-chapter-1 5 https:\/\/sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0140988317301226 6 https:\/\/www.carbonbrief.org\/explainer-the-high-emissions-rcp8-5-global-warming-scenario\/ 7 https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/d41586-020-00177-3 8 https:\/\/www.aei.org\/carpe-diem\/18-spectacularly-wrong-predictions-were-made-around-the-time-of-the-first-earth-day-in-1970-expect- more-this-year\/ 9 https:\/\/www.sciencedaily.com\/releases\/2020\/04\/200430113003.htm 10 https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/environment\/2023\/nov\/27\/us-oil-gas-record-fossil-fuels-cop28-united-nations 11 https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/chevron-bets-on-peak-green-energy-99e72109 2024 Proxy Statement 127",

            "introduction":"This document provides information regarding ConocoPhillips' equity compensation plans as of December 31, 2023, and includes two stockholder proposals to be presented at the Annual Meeting. It details the number of securities to be issued, exercise prices, and remaining availability for future issuance under existing equity compensation plans, as well as the proposals concerning a simple majority vote requirement and revisiting pay incentives for GHG emission reductions.",
            "main_points":"The equity compensation plan information outlines the approved plans, the number of securities to be issued upon exercise of options, the weighted average exercise price, and the number of securities remaining available for future issuance, emphasizing that no additional awards can be granted under the older plans after the 2023 Omnibus Stock and Performance Incentive Plan approval. It addresses the treatment of restricted stock and restricted stock units (RSUs), dividend equivalents, and the vesting schedules for various employee groups, including executives, and also mentions adjustments made following mergers and acquisitions. The first stockholder proposal (Item 4) requests a shift to a simple majority vote requirement in the company's charter and bylaws, while the second stockholder proposal (Item 5) advocates for revisiting pay incentives tied to GHG emission reductions, arguing that climate change scenarios are often overstated.",
            "conclusion":"ConocoPhillips' board supports the stockholder proposal regarding a simple majority vote, while the proposal regarding pay incentives for GHG emissions reductions is presented for consideration. The details provided are essential for shareholders to make informed decisions during the Annual Meeting."

[Page 128] \u2022 According to the Company\u2019s 2023 Proxy Statement, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee set a Variable Cash Incentive Program target of 14 percent of total compensation for the CEO and 16 percent for other Named Executive Officers.12 \u2022 \u201cStrategic and ESG Milestones\u201d are one of the five metrics used to determine VCIP for NEOs. [Page 128] These milestones include: - \u201cDemonstrated meaningful progress toward our Paris-aligned climate risk framework.\u201d - \u201cProgressed our long-term strategy by establishing new methane and flaring targets, executing emission reduction projects, and progressing CCS business development opportunities.\u201d These VCIP metrics are unscientific and create a breach of fiduciary duty. [Page 128] ConocoPhillips is an oil and gas company and should focus on what it does best. [Page 128] The company cannot afford to be left behind because of misguided executive pay incentives. [Page 128] Resolved: Shareholders of ConocoPhillips request the Board of Directors\u2019 Human Resources and Compensation Committee to revisit its incentive guidelines for executive pay, to emphasize legitimate fiduciary goals and consider eliminating greenhouse gas reduction targets and other scientifically dubious goals from compensation inducements. [Page 128] What vote is required to approve this proposal? [Page 128] Approval of this proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal. [Page 128] WHAT DOES THE BOARD RECOMMEND? [Page 128] The Board recommends you vote AGAINST this proposal for the following reasons: The Board has carefully considered the recommendations set forth in the proposal and we believe the changes suggested are not in the best interest of ConocoPhillips or our stockholders for the following reasons: Our executive compensation is aligned with our company strategy and with the long-term interests of our stockholders. [Page 128] ConocoPhillips continues to be guided by our value proposition of superior returns to stockholders through price cycles while executing against our Triple Mandate, which sets out three objectives to align our actions with the underlying realities of our business and demonstrates our commitment to create long-term value for our stockholders. [Page 128] Our Triple Mandate includes reliably and responsibly delivering oil and gas production to meet energy transition pathway demand, delivering returns on and of capital for our stockholders, and remaining focused on achieving our net-zero operational emissions ambition. [Page 128] Consistent with our philosophy of aligning our executive compensation programs with company strategy and with the long-term interests of our stockholders, our executive compensation programs and metrics remain aligned with our value proposition and Triple Mandate (see page 72). [Page 128] An overwhelming majority of our stockholders have expressed a desire for us to link compensation with our climate commitments. [Page 128] We regularly meet with stockholders on a variety of topics, including our executive compensation programs. [Page 128] In recent years, during these engagements, an overwhelming majority of stockholders have sought to confirm how we link progress on our climate commitments to our executive compensation programs. [Page 128] Recently, ConocoPhillips created a separately weighted measure (10 percent) for \u201cEnergy Transition Milestones,\u201d for our short-term incentive program (see page 82), and almost all of our stockholders supported our modified compensation program. [Page 128] For more information on our stockholder engagement, see \u201cStockholder Engagement and Board Responsiveness\u201d beginning on page 45 and \u201c2023 Say on Pay Vote Result, Stockholder Engagement, and Board Responsiveness\u201d beginning on page 69.

        "summarization":{
            "introduction":"This document analyzes a stockholder proposal for ConocoPhillips to revisit its executive pay incentives, specifically regarding greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction targets. The proposal argues that these targets are unscientific and create a breach of fiduciary duty.",
            "main_points":"The stockholder proposal requests the Board of Directors' Human Resources and Compensation Committee to revise executive pay guidelines, emphasizing fiduciary goals and eliminating GHG reduction targets. The company's executive pay program currently incorporates incentives tied to climate change mitigation, with \"Strategic and ESG Milestones\" as a metric in the Variable Cash Incentive Program (VCIP) for Named Executive Officers (NEOs). The Board of Directors recommends voting against the proposal, arguing that executive compensation aligns with the company's strategy, long-term stockholder interests, and the Triple Mandate, which includes achieving net-zero operational emissions. The Board highlights that an overwhelming majority of stockholders have expressed support for linking compensation to climate commitments and that the company has already created a separate measure for \"Energy Transition Milestones\" in its short-term incentive program. The document also provides details on submitting future stockholder proposals, proxy access nominations, and attending the virtual annual meeting, along with voting procedures for both record and beneficial stockholders.",
            "conclusion":"The stockholder proposal to revisit executive pay incentives related to GHG emission reductions is opposed by the Board, who believe the current compensation structure is aligned with company strategy and stockholder interests. The vote required to approve the proposal is the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting."

[Page 136] If you change your mind and would like to receive paper copies of our proxy statements and annual reports, you can request both by phone at (800) 579-1639, by email at sendmaterial@proxyvote.com, and online at www.proxyvote.com. [Page 136] You will need the 16-digit control number located on your Notice of Internet Availability to request a package. [Page 136] You will also have an opportunity to request future proxy statements and annual reports by mail. [Page 136] Why did my household receive a single set of proxy materials? [Page 136] SEC rules permit us to deliver a single copy of an annual report and proxy statement to any household at which two or more stockholders reside if we believe the stockholders are members of the same family. [Page 136] This benefits both you and ConocoPhillips, as it eliminates duplicate mailings and reduces our printing and mailing costs. [Page 136] Each stockholder will continue to receive a separate proxy card or voting instruction card. [Page 136] Your household may have received a single set of proxy materials this year. [Page 136] If you prefer to receive your own copy now or in future years, please request a duplicate set by phone at (800) 579-1639, online at www.proxyvote.com, or by email at sendmaterial@proxyvote.com. [Page 136] If you hold your stock in street name, you may receive some duplicate mailings. [Page 136] Certain brokers will eliminate duplicate account mailings on request. [Page 136] You may need to contact your broker directly if you want to discontinue duplicate mailings to your household.

[Page 137] Special items are items that management believes are unusual or nonrecurring and not indicative of our core operating results or business outlook over the long term. [Page 137] Management believes adjusted earnings is useful to investors in evaluating our operating results, understanding our operating trends across periods on a consistent basis, and providing comparability with the performance of peer companies. [Page 137] Adjusted EPS Adjusted EPS is a measure of the company\u2019s diluted net earnings per share excluding special items. [Page 137] Special items are items that management believes are unusual or nonrecurring and not indicative of our core operating results or business outlook over the long term. [Page 137] Management believes adjusted earnings per share is useful to investors in evaluating our operating results, understanding our operating trends across periods on a consistent basis and providing comparability with the performance of peer companies. [Page 137] Cash from Operations (CFO) Cash from operations (CFO) is calculated by removing the impact from operating working capital from cash provided by operating activities. [Page 137] The company believes that the non-GAAP measure cash from operations is useful to investors to help understand changes in cash provided by operating activities excluding the impact of working capital changes across periods on a consistent basis and with the performance of peer companies in a manner that, when viewed in combination with the company\u2019s results prepared in accordance with GAAP, provides a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the company\u2019s business and performance. [Page 137] Free Cash Flow Free Cash Flow is defined as cash from operations net of capital expenditures and investments. [Page 137] The company believes free cash flow is useful to investors in understanding how existing cash from operations is utilized as a source for sustaining our current capital plan and future development growth. [Page 137] Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since the company has certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure. [Page 137] Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) Return on capital employed (ROCE) is a measure of the profitability of the company\u2019s capital employed in its business operations compared with that of its peers. [Page 137] The company calculates ROCE as a ratio, the numerator of which is net income, and the denominator of which is average total equity plus average total debt. [Page 137] The net income is adjusted for after-tax interest expense, for the purposes of measuring efficiency of debt capital used in operations; net income is also adjusted for non-operational or special items impacts to allow for comparability in the long-term view across periods. [Page 137] The company believes ROCE is a good indicator of long-term company and management performance as it relates to capital efficiency, both absolute and relative to the company\u2019s primary peer group.

[Page 3] If no carbon tax exists for the asset, it is not included in the cash flow forecasts; Cost of Supply displayed in WTI, includes carbon tax where carbon policy exists and a proxy carbon price for assets without existing carbon policies. [Page 3] Please refer to the Cost of Supply definition in the Appendix for additional information on how carbon costs are included in the Cost of Supply calculation As a result, this presentation contains forward-looking statements as defined under the federal securities laws. [Page 3] Forward-looking statements relate to future events, plans and anticipated results of operations, business strategies, and other aspects of our operations or operating results. [Page 3] Graphics that project into a future date constitute forward-looking statements. [Page 3] Also, words and phrases such as \u201canticipate,\u201d \"estimate,\" \"believe,\" \"budget,\" \"continue,\" *could,* \u201cintend,\u201d \"may,\" \"plan,\" \"potential,\" \"predict,\" \u201cseek,* \"should,\" \"will\" \u2018would,\" expect,\" \u201cobjective,\u201d \u2018projection,\u2019 \"forecast,\" \"goal,\" \"guidance,\" \u201coutlook,\u201d \u2018effort, \"target\" and other similar words can be used to identify forward-looking statements. [Page 3] However, the absence of these words does not mean that the statements are not forward-looking. [Page 3] Where, in any forward-looking statement, the company expresses an expectation or belief as to future results, such expectation or belief is based on management's good faith plans and objectives under the assumptions set forth above (unless noted otherwise) and believed to be reasonable as of April 12, 2023, the date of this presentation. [Page 3] These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks and uncertainties and are subject to change as management is continually assessing factors beyond our control that may or may not be currently known. [Page 3] Given the foregoing and the extended time horizon of this presentation, actual outcomes and results will likely differ from what is expressed or forecast in the forward-looking statements, and such differences may be material Factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from what is presented include changes in commodity prices, including a prolonged decline in these prices relative to historical or future expected levels; global and regional changes in the demand, supply, prices, differentials or other market conditions affecting oil and gas, including changes resulting from any ongoing military conflict, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the global response to such conflict, security threats on facilities and infrastructure, or from a public health crisis or from the imposition or lifting of crude oil production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by OPEC and other producing countries and the resulting company or third-party actions in response to such changes; insufficient liquidity or other factors, such as those listed herein, that could impact our ability to repurchase shares and declare and pay dividends such that we suspend our share repurchase program and reduce, suspend, or totally eliminate dividend payments in the future, whether variable or fixed; changes in expected levels of oil and gas reserves or production; potential failures or delays in achieving expected reserve or production levels from existing and future oil and gas developments, including due to operating hazards, drilling risks or unsuccessful exploratory activities; unexpected cost increases, inflationary pressures or technical difficulties in constructing, maintaining or modifying company facilities; legislative and regulatory initiatives addressing global climate change or other environmental concerns; public health crises, including pandemics (such as COVID-19) and epidemics and any impacts or related company or government policies or actions; investment in and development of competing or alternative energy sources; potential failures or delays in delivering on our current or future low-carbon strategy, including our inability to develop new technologies; disruptions or interruptions impacting the transportation for our oil and gas production; international monetary conditions and exchange rate fluctuations; changes in international trade relationships or governmental policies, including the imposition of price caps or the imposition of trade restrictions or tariffs on any materials or products (such as aluminum and steel) used in the operation of our business, including any sanctions imposed as a result of any ongoing military conflict, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine; our ability to collect payments when due, including our ability to collect payments from the government of Venezuela or PDVSA; our ability to complete any announced or any future dispositions or acquisitions on time, if at all; the possibility that regulatory approvals for any announced or any future dispositions or acquisitions will not be received on a timely basis, if at all, or that such approvals may require modification to the terms of the transactions or our remaining business; business disruptions following any announced or future dispositions or acquisitions, including the diversion of management time and attention; the ability to deploy net proceeds from our announced or any future dispositions in the manner and timeframe we anticipate, if at all; potential liability for remedial actions under existing or future environmental regulations; potential liability resulting from pending or future litigation, including litigation related directly or indirectly to our transaction with Concho Resources Inc; the impact of competition and consolidation in the oil and gas industry; limited access to capital or insurance or significantly higher cost of capital or insurance related to illiquidity or uncertainty in the domestic or international financial markets or investor sentiment; general domestic and international economic and political conditions or developments, including as a result of any ongoing military conflict, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine; changes in fiscal regime or tax, environmental and other laws applicable to our business; and disruptions resulting from accidents, extraordinary weather events, civil unrest, political events, war, terrorism, cybersecurity threats or information technology failures, constraints or disruptions; and other economic, business, competitive and\/or regulatory factors affecting our business generally as set forth in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. [Page 3] Unless legally required, ConocoPhillips expressly disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. [Page 3] We assume no duty to update these statements as of any future date and neither future distribution of this material nor the continued availability of this material in archive form on our website should be deemed to constitute an update or re-affirmation of these figures as of any future date. [Page 3] Any future update of these figures will be provided only through a public disclosure indicating that fact. [Page 3] Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information ~ This presentation includes non-GAAP financial measures, which help facilitate comparison of company operating performance across periods and with peer companies. [Page 3] Any historical non-GAAP measures included herein will be accompanied by a reconciliation to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure both at the end of this presentation and on our website at wavw.conocophilips.com\/nongagp. [Page 3] For forward-looking non-GAAP measures, we are unable to provide a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because the information needed to reconcile these measures is dependent on future events, many of which are outside management's control as described above. [Page 3] Additionally, estimating such GAAP measures and providing a meaningful reconciliation consistent with our accounting policies for future periods is extremely difficult and requires a level of precision that is unavailable for these future periods and cannot be accomplished without unreasonable effort. [Page 3] Forward looking non-GAAP measures are estimated consistent with the relevant definitions and assumptions. [Page 3] Cautionary Note to US. [Page 3] Investors ~ The SEC permits oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only proved, probable and possible reserves.

        "chunk_text":"[Page 61] Definitions ww Non-GAAP Measures Cash from operations (CFO) is calculated by removing the impact from operating working capital from cash provided by operating activities. [Page 61] The company believes that the non- GAAP measure cash from operations is useful to investors to help understand changes in cash provided by operating activities excluding the impact of working capital changes across periods on a consistent basis and with the performance of peer companies in a manner that, when viewed in combination with the Company's results prepared in accordance with GAAP provides a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the Company's business and performance. [Page 61] Additionally, when the company estimates CFO based on sensitivities, it assumes no operating working capital changes, and therefore CFO equals cash provided by operating activities. [Page 61] Free cash flow is defined as cash from operations net of capital expenditures and investments. [Page 61] The company believes free cash flow is useful to investors in understanding how existing cash from operations is utilized as a source for sustaining our current capital plan and future development growth. [Page 61] Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since the company has certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure. [Page 61] Net debt includes total balance sheet debt less cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. [Page 61] The company believes this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors as it provides a measure to compare debt less cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments across periods on a consistent basis. [Page 61] Reinvestment rate defined as total capital expenditures divided by cash from operations. [Page 61] Cash from operations is a non-GAAP measure defined in this Appendix. [Page 61] The company believes reinvestment rate is useful to investors in understanding the execution of the company\u2019s disciplined and returns-focused capital allocation strategy. [Page 61] Return on capital employed (ROCE) is a measure of the profitability of the company\u2019s capital employed in its business operations compared with that of its peers. [Page 61] The company calculates ROCE as a ratio, the numerator of which is net income, and the denominator of which is average total equity plus average total debt. [Page 61] The net income is adjusted for after-tax interest expense, for the purposes of measuring efficiency of debt capital used in operations; net income is also adjusted for non-operational or special items impacts to allow for comparability in the long-term view across periods. [Page 61] The company believes ROCE is a good indicator of long-term company and management performance as it relates to capital efficiency, both absolute and relative to the company\u2019s primary peer group. [Page 61] ConocoPhillips 61 [Page 62] Definitions ww Other Terms Cost of Supply is the WTI equivalent price that generates a 10% after-tax return on a point-forward and fully burdened basis. [Page 62] Fully burdened includes capital infrastructure, foreign exchange, price-related inflation, G&A and carbon tax (if currently assessed). [Page 62] If no carbon tax exists for the asset, carbon pricing aligned with internal energy scenarios are applied. [Page 62] All barrels of resource in the Cost of Supply calculation are discounted at 10%. [Page 62] Distributions is defined as the total of the ordinary dividend, share repurchases and variable return of cash (VROC). [Page 62] Also referred to as return of capital. [Page 62] Free cash flow breakeven is the WTI price at which cash from operations equals capital expenditures and investments. [Page 62] Also referred to as capital breakeven. [Page 62] Cash from operations is anon-GAAP measure defined in this Appendix. [Page 62] Leverage ratio refers to net debt divided by cash from operations. [Page 62] Net debt and cash from operations are non-GAAP measures defined in this Appendix. [Page 62] Optimized Cascade\u00ae Process is a ConocoPhillips proprietary licensed process for technology to liquefy natural gas. [Page 62] More information can be found at http:\/\/Inglicensing.conocophillips.com\/what-we-do\/Ing-technology\/optimized-cascade-process. [Page 62] Reserve replacement is defined by the Company as a ratio representing the change in proved reserves, net of production, divided by current year production. [Page 62] The Company believes that reserve replacement is useful to investors to help understand how changes in proved reserves, net of production, compare with the Company's current year production, inclusive of acquisitions and dispositions. [Page 62] Resources: The company estimates its total resources based on the Petroleum Resources Management System (PRMS), a system developed by industry that classifies recoverable hydrocarbons into commercial and sub-commercial to reflect their status at the time of reporting. [Page 62] Proved, probable and possible reserves are classified as commercial, while remaining resources are categorized as sub-commercial or contingent. [Page 62] The company\u2019s resource estimate includes volumes associated with both commercial and contingent categories. [Page 62] The SEC permits oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only proved, probable and possible reserves. [Page 62] U.S. [Page 62] investors are urged to consider closely the oil and gas disclosures in our Form 10-K and other reports and filings with the SEC. [Page 62] Resource life is calculated as total resource under $40 Cost of Supply divided by 2022 production. [Page 62] Return of capital is defined as the total of the ordinary dividend, share repurchases and variable return of cash (VROC). [Page 62] Also referred to as distributions.
